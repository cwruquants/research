## Folder Structure
- citations: past work, reference papers, resources that we're basing our work off of
- progress: where Ethan logs assigned work, work finished, etc.
- results: where our trial jsons are stored so we can see progression
- src: where all of our code is stored
- vault: where our massive data file will be stored as we build out our features

# TODO:
1. risk count, risk percentage
2. send KeyBERT reference to Prof.
3. run the bigrams specifically from the paper (/research/citations/input/political_bigrams/political_bigrams.csv) (comparison between bigram and non-bigram trial)
4. reschedule the calendar
