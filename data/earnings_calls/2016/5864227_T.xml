Presentation

 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning and welcome. And those of you that joined us last night, thank you very much. The team did a great job putting on that event and appreciate all the effort went into that; beautiful facility.
 Lots of great questions and we committed to, as we have in the past at these meetings, addressing your concerns about the Company, staying here as long as it takes. Those themes also carry over. We are in very interesting times and I think one of the recurring themes of the discussions last night informally was this whole -- the challenge to us of, gee, there seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and a lot of uncertainty or challenges or disruptions in markets and what does that feel like.
 So, as the introduction to today and a very full agenda with a large part of our management team here, I'm going to try to frame that dialogue. Raghu mentioned the venue across the hall for the breaks. We have a large portion of our management team here. Please put them to work when you are over there. It's a good chance informally to meet some of our folks and find out their thoughts on where we are going and how things are progressing, as well as the formal presentations.
 But I guess where I am seven months into the role -- 21st year with the Group, for those of you that don't know me. One of the things that we have historically done very well is benefited from disruptions and I guess I'm a little surprised that's not part of the narrative last night.
 I think we discussed it a bit, but there is -- if you think through the material changes we've seen as a company, and certainly some of the things that are being generally categorized as headwinds or challenges now, most of them disrupt the relationships in the value chain between the end consumer, the advice provider, and the solutions manufacturer. And we see a lot of opportunity in that.
 I think it's not an opportunity available to every firm in the marketplace. I think there's attributes that you need. I think there's capabilities you need, markets you need. But I want to spend a couple of minutes and walk you through why I believe that, some of which -- with some well-rehearsed slides that I think you are very familiar with, but I think they revolve around some general ideas.
 The strategy is correct. The position we have in the marketplace is strong enough, broad enough, and defined enough that we have the capabilities to outperform and that has a variety of dynamics to it. We have an operating model that's not dependent on any one market, any one product, any one element of macroeconomics, interest rates, equity performance, volatility, etc., so it's the resilience gives us optionality.
 We have the headroom to actually capture the upside that I think is in front of us. And this is critical: this is operational headroom, this is capital formation. There's a variety of attributes to this that are key because only certain firms can do this at this point in the cycle if this is, in fact, an inflection point.
 And then, finally, we can convert that to profitable growth, profitable growth to free surplus, free surplus to dividend, cash flow, and growth in the share price.
 So, the strategy. We've talked about this before. I think we can't start the day without saying are the fundamental assumptions you make in your strategy correct. Do they still hold? Are they threatened by external factors?
 So, Asia. Is there still a significant protection gap if there's uncertainty in China and if there's regulatory change, political changes, if there's countries growing at different paces? Is any of that, candidly, new to the business model?
 We didn't go into Asia with a strategy of all markets would grow all the time, tailwinds all the time. That was never a part of the discussion. It was never a part of their plan of execution. It's why we have a portfolio, etc.
 But do we think that's true. Do we think the US Baby Boomers will behave materially differently if there's a change in DOL, a change in market volatility in the US? Do we think in the UK with Pensions Freedom and Solvency II that the landscape changes? And does that eliminate or change the material, structural opportunities we have in these three markets?
 So, let me just spend just a little bit of time on this. So, let's do some simple demographics.
 Two major trends we have built our strategy and our thinking around. One is the changes in demographics in Asia, that is the emergence of the middle class, working population. Again, two-thirds of our relationships to these clients are first-time buyers of products or services like ours.
 Then in the Western markets, in the US and UK, the Baby Boomers in the US, their equivalents in the UK, and in all of these markets a disproportionate amount of responsibility being put on the individuals for their own health, wealth, and protection. Is the money there?
 When we get into the wealth footprint, the markets that we are in account for 63% of the world's wealth. The forecasts and projections you get from various experts and consultants generally model that forward at similar levels.
 So does a disruption in the type of wealth by age matter? Well, yes, you are getting more drawdown at 65-plus, but again, as we've seen in the last financial crisis in the US, the consumers tend to get more conservative when they are worried about market returns in their withdrawal behavior and their consumption. They are careful with money, so we don't think that changes materially.
 What types of wealth? Has this changed? The answer is, no. You still see in the US and the UK similar levels of equity investment, slightly different levels now of bond investment, but the cash component in Asia as the buffer for health and wealth protection, for taking care of family, that hasn't changed.
 So as the growth of Asia across the region continues, the inefficient, candidly, use of cash as a protection device while these people grow in net worth and move on their personal financial journeys will be replaced by protection products and further investment in things that provide higher return to their households. So that demand is still there.
 So if it's there, do we have the products and services to address it, or are we going to run out and build them? And if we have those products and services with existing clients, what are they going to look like with disruptions in equity, or interest rates, or volatility in markets? And will those clients leave us and do they stay? If you have a bear sort of mindset, that is a fair question.
 If we take a look for a second how equity clients invest with us and how clients' retirement savings are invested with us, what you see are highly-diversified portfolios, very capable teams managing them, performing for the clients. And what you don't see is a Shanghai Index focus; what you don't see is an aggressive growth fund US focus; what you don't see are a levered equity play contingent on high returns in UK equity markets. That's not our space.
 We are in the space where the consumer says, for the serious part of my money, I need help with the asset allocation, I need help with the diversification, I need retirement solutions that are long term, and I'm looking for some stability. That's our space.
 So, when you are modeling how behavior in markets changes, we have conservative portfolios. They fit the clients' needs and expectations and we think they are very well-positioned for what clients will want if it's a climate of uncertainty.
 Let's go to Asia specifically. We've shown you this slide a couple different ways. This is the life premium per capita -- and the Asian folks, again, will get much more granular than I'm going to today on this -- and you've seen versions of this idea before based on the US as the baseline. And what are we seeing?
 Well, you are seeing the development of these markets in a couple of different ways. We've shown you before the speed is developing faster than Western markets. I think one of the interesting pieces for Hong Kong and Singapore, the consumption rate is now above Western markets.
 Now, is that a function of the nature of savers in the market and the importance on savings? Is it a function of the perceived volatility in the market, so there's more to protect? Is it the rate at which wealth has grown?
 But for us, we are looking at markets that we think have tremendous upside and appetite for the product and actually more appetite than the industry can produce proper product for. The structural opportunity in terms of volume and capacity is still there, so who gets it?
 Scale, I think, is a prerequisite. I think you need a pan-regional franchise -- there is effectively two of us in the marketplace. You are going to have to do a lot of different things for consumers to maintain and support your existing clients and distribution base. You are going to do a lot of new and interesting things to get them to buy a second product, to get new distributors, to get new consumers to come to you.
 And to do that and to stay with those clients past that first transaction and stay with them on their financial journey, if you will, as they mature as consumers, you are going to need asset management, you are going to need protection, you are going to need health, you are going to need multiple platforms if they change countries, and you need the scale to divide those cost capabilities across the markets. You need the brand; you need the regulatory relationships; you need the existing licenses. These are all attributes of scale that we have.
 Penetration; is the market still there? We have markets that individually -- I'll give you a little more granular look -- very, very low penetration rates, very strong market positions for us.
 When I look at this slide, I see it more as a challenge in capacity. Can we ramp up the back office? Can we ramp up our distribution institutionally to actually be able to meet this level of demand?
 Summed up -- and again the sum is a little simplistic, but it's important to see just our scale and region -- the penetration rates are fractional. Again, I would argue the structural opportunity is there.
 Moving to us. We have multiple growth engines in region. We are not dependent on a single company -- country, excuse me; companies in country. Why does this matter? They are evolving at different times. There's different political and economic issues. There's different demographic issues and it gives us discipline.
 Tony and I were talking yesterday -- didn't tell him I was going to say this -- but if you said what do we see as probably the biggest bump in Asia or disruption in Asia temporarily, it's an irrational competitor. Is that fair? It's not the macro issues. Is that (inaudible)?
 It's the same thing -- somebody comes into one of these markets, they've been sent by their board; their job is to get a pin in a map in Asia. And they are not looking at cash flow; they are not looking at price. They are not looking for sustainable relationships and costs and structure. And that's a challenge in that market, because the markets have put a premium on the earnings out of Asia and so you see some irrational behavior.
 We have the challenge and the luxury both of having to back off in a market if we need to; back off in a product in a market if we need to if someone wants to be undisciplined. I can tell you standing up here as a member of the US team pre-crisis, it was a huge luxury to have the Group support to not have to sell or drive top line on a product and industry trends at the time that we didn't think were appropriate or sustainable. It's one of the benefits of the Group. It's certainly one of the benefits of the portfolio of companies we have in Asia.
 The other is the learnings from the more developed markets we can drop into our more nascent, more emerging markets. So we can accelerate our experience, our success as a group and certainly in the region to move these new markets up. And, again, the populations and scale and opportunities here are big.
 Well, what are you driving? We are driving recurring premium. Disproportionally, 90% of the time we are driving recurring premium. Why? First off, it's indifferent to markets.
 In some ways, if you think of the consumer's decision between an appetite for headlines where the markets are going up and up and up and our ability to get them to be conservative in the behavior in that climate versus a climate where there is more uncertainty, this is actually a more favorable climate for us in a lot of ways. What you see typically is the more uncertainty perceived, the more stable your back book.
 Now, our existing book of clients, our existing relationships with consumers, and our existing relationships with distributors require work. The quality of the service, the protection of those -- as we've talked multiple times before, the protection of the reputation of that bank assurance partner, that agent or agency office, is a key part of what we need to do, because they can only grow their business if we take care of their clients. And their clients will only stay with us if we take care of their clients.
 So there is a work stream involved with the recurring premium and earning it, but I want to show you a little more granular look at it today. It's an incredible capability that this Group has that I don't believe is properly valued.
 From a weighted-premium point of view, the blue is the in-force; the red is our new business. And, again, look at the growth of the in-force in contributing to these metrics.
 Earnings and cash. How does it emerge? Same. Again, you've got the cohorts of the back book starting to drive current and future earnings. You've got this in front of you, so just out of respect for time today, I'm not going to go through line by line.
 But we've talked before about vintages and cohorts per year of earnings. Let's take a little more granular look at that.
 Combined with that are new business profits on top of that back book. And remember the new business profits emerge over time, but for the owners of the Company in the room, you own these relationships. So you own these future earnings; they are embedded in the Company.
 The growth of these earnings unassisted by new sales -- not that new sales have any issues. I was very careful when I was thinking about how to convey this; this is a different issue than our ability to sell. But the back book that you own, the relationships with consumers you own grow faster than most companies in our segment. I think that's a pretty unique set of strengths.
 Is it measurable? Of course. IFRS operating profits and, importantly, free surplus, which leads again to our ability to maintain a dividend strategy that's based on growth of earnings.
 So Asia has got the right attributes from a scale point of view, from a market point of view, from a competitive point of view and I don't personally see any of those challenged with any sort of market uncertainty. In many ways, they are enhanced by that.
 Let's go to the US. So I had a couple of slides that I pulled that would have shown you trends on Baby Boomers, some of the market dynamics in the United States. I think I have, over 20 years, been up here so many times talking about Baby Boomers I can name all 10,000 retiring a day and I decided to stay away from that.
 They are still retiring. That pool of money is still moving through. So the big disruption that people are concerned about in the United States right now is the Department of Labor is potentially, likely -- I will let Barry address this in specific -- changing the ruling on how advice is provided and what the structure of retirement products and savings are in the United States. The general view is it could happen before the end of the president's term.
 Okay. So, we are talking about one of the most important opportunities in our business in a long time. Again, the value chain of who provides advice, how they do it, what the products and services will look like will be up for grabs. There will be a realignment of the players if the worst-case scenario is true.
 Now, stopping for a second, there's been some very good work out. I appreciate it. I do read the stuff that you guys publish and I do appreciate the insights from it. There's been a couple of examples where it's measured in a linear basis. This is what it would look like.
 If we lost all of the VA sales, we've told you it's about 2% of Group earnings -- qualified sales, excuse me -- that's an interesting scenario. But I don't personally believe it's possible to predict the shape of the event. So is there a phase-in period? If there is, are we selling product through that?
 One of the things I think you should measure when you look at our competitors in the US against Jackson's capabilities right now is, if nothing happens, who's winning? If there is a period of time where the change is known, who wins? If the changes happen quickly, who wins?
 So we have the number one franchise now, and I think for the right reasons. We have the attributes I think to be -- if the advisors know that it's going to change in eight months or 12 months, I think we are better positioned to capitalize on that -- again, attributes of scale -- than our competition.
 And if it changes, I think we have the attributes to get to market faster, with more innovation, than competitors. Why? We have the best product in the marketplace.
 Product quality matters. It matters for retention of earnings, for creation of the ongoing cash flow and capital. It also goes to brand reputation: the clients' ability to do more with you, the advisors' desire to do more with you. Think of elite access. We have permission from those advisors to go into more complex products that no competitor has yet been able to replicate.
 There is a -- if what you are providing for the consumers works, your options in the market are much greater. Ours works.
 This is a measurement of three-year returns of the portfolios in the variable annuity. Now they are disproportionately valued -- you have the allocation on a previous slide, I didn't put them both on one. But, basically, we have 9 times the number of funds in perspective over the last three years that have provided the client a 10%-plus rate of return.
 Why does that matter? Well, clients don't think -- I've never met a consumer that could tell you what the S&amp;P return was in 2014. What they can tell you is their return expectation over the life of their assets.
 And those numbers vary, it's always a range. But they need to be able to invest in things that actually produce growth or this is a drawdown product, which we've seen with a lot of competitors.
 This is a product that has provided growth for consumers across the cycle: protection when they needed it, the assets grew back. We've gone through this story before, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do. So again, that gives us permission with our distributors, with regulators, with consumers, with the advisors themselves to do more.
 Elite access. It was as much about advisor education as it is product quality. That's why Jackson did so much better than its peers with that. We are very good at bringing information to the market, so if there's a disruption, if there's complicated new rules, we are the logical provider of that support to advisors. We earn that and, again, that's an attribute that we need.
 Now, can we do it? Of course, we have the most levered distribution and most effective wholesaling team in the industry: largest, highest producing, best trained, most tenured. Those relationships are well-developed.
 What if there's a difference in price? We have the best technology, industry's best service, and we can provide it at a cost that competitors can't. So we're at a price advantage.
 These are the attributes I think you are going to need. There's some other elements to it. If there is a disruption, what does it do to earnings? Well, you need a profitable back book, well structured to provide earnings and cash flow and growth to support not only the US ambition, but the Group, its dividend, etc. We have that.
 The general account. I will let the team later get into detail, but we've told you for a long time we've been up in quality for a while, so it's defensive. The technology service/IT, best in the industry, fastest to market. Talked about the distribution. I think Jackson is incredibly well-positioned.
 UK. Pensions Freedom, Solvency II, and the general concept when you talk to consumers in London in my almost nine months here now, they are both concerned and a little excited about the ability to take control of their own finances in the sense of their retirement assets. It's a very interesting dialogue.
 I've long-joked with some of you that, if I want to be left alone on a flight, I tell people I'm in the insurance business. If I want to talk to a person next to me, I tell them I work with investments and at they won't stop talking till the plane lands in Hong Kong. People are very interested in this space.
 But it's a very difficult time to hand this responsibility to consumers. It's not an obvious period of time, if this is your first time as an investor rolling over your pension assets, to know what to do with the funds. So again, that disruption creates opportunity.
 Between Solvency II, the political climate, low rates, the fixed-guarantee products are out of favor, the annuities. They are more capital intensive. The consumers don't want to lock in that level of fixed return and so the options go towards asset-based products, investment-based products, which for us, as shareholders and management, are capital-light and go to things that we are very good at.
 Again, best performing with profits product. Start with a good product and franchise and you have optionality in the market, because you can demonstrate expertise, you have trust -- all of the things we just talked about in the US. The capabilities across the market between M&amp;G and Pru UK -- and John Foley was announced today, you'll see, as our -- if you didn't get up at 4 in the morning -- as our new head of our UK business. And I will let John and his team talk, but we've put more under that; we've aligned more of the resources under that business, the things that they should appropriately manage. And I think structurally and both talent-wise we ended up in a great place there.
 M&amp;G as well we have the asset management capabilities, so there's no product or service that we can't create that the market demands. And, again, without stealing their thunder, there's an existing-client/new-client model here that we are going to pursue. This market is, by all predictions -- and I think they are reasonable -- should grow between 8% and 10% a year. We'd like a disproportionate amount of our fair share of that, as there's no reason with Pru's brand and attributes that we shouldn't get it.
 Okay, let's go to the Group for a minute. So what is it we are doing with our time? This all sounds like it's going pretty well. What is it we do day-to-day then?
 This is where our focus is and I guess I would back up a half step from this. If you think about -- I've said this a couple of times this morning. We have client acquisition on one end and retention, so what do we do to take care of our existing clients, our existing advisors? There's a lot to do there. When we start going through these just think about that.
 Then the next piece is, as we expand, as we add. So we add new distribution relationships; as we add new individual distributors, agents, advisors; as we add new relationships with existing clients; as we add new relationships with clients we don't have; as we look at buying blocks of business; as we look at new markets. We are trying to make sure, from a Group perspective, we have the scale and capabilities to do all that concurrently. And I think we do.
 And there's more to do. Asia is going to continue to build out its scale; better penetration. We have the best-performing bank assurance relationships, but there's a ton of room in those to go. You will see us follow the clients there and that's a journey that we have great partners on.
 The scale up, the nascent businesses; again, we know what we need to do in these markets. Even going back to bank assurance for a second, we know what Standard Charter looked like when it was new. That's held out as the best bank partnership from a performance point of view in the region.
 It wasn't the first week; it wasn't the first year, and the people that built that are here in this room. And if you want to -- they know what you need to do to change the culture of a bank branch to see that they've got a partner that they are going to work with for the next 15 years. There's a skill set in that.
 We know institutionally how to develop agency forces at scale. If that market is -- if you believe the demographics on the market are correct, we need to be much bigger than we are now. That means our training, our infrastructure, our ability to develop talented agents has to be bigger and greater.
 And so those of you who have been in that region know we have sort of an institutionalized model for that; very effective development of agency force. I think the definition of agency varies and will vary through the presentations today. If you look at an agent in one of our newest markets and an agent in Hong Kong or Singapore, the definition is stretched because it means different things in different markets. But they work with us and we need to maintain -- continue to grow that.
 Digital. Al-Noor Ramji is here somewhere, if you haven't had a chance to meet him. We brought on a Head of Digital for the Group.
 We already have digital in the business units; this is not a shift in strategy. This is bringing more resources to bear on what's one of the ways we need to interact with customers and advisors. But there's lots going on in this space and, given the importance of it, we want resources that are appropriate for that and we are very pleased he joined us.
 Bolt-ons in the US. There has been a feeding frenzy last year in some very competitively-priced transactions. A little bit of market uncertainty probably helps us on that front. A little bit of -- some of the more technical transactions we are the more logical owner of.
 There's lots to do there. The team is working on that, again, in a disciplined fashion. We don't need to do anything, but you have bought and paid for a platform that can extract value out of a competitor at a level that's unique in the US. So if we can utilize that, we will.
 In the UK, evolving how we are interacting with clients, breadth of products, staying with the changes in the market. It's probably the most fluid market from an advice point of view currently pre any DOL changes, because you see support from the government and socially for more advice. As that advice develops, you'll see us bring more and more solutions, so lots to do there.
 How does that respond historically? Pretty well. And what I couldn't get up on this chart -- you've seen this before. You've got total AUM. We've talked about earnings, but the -- again, you are just not seeing the disruptions.
 But the piece I couldn't get up here is how do you explain the growth in capability? What single line would say the things we can do now that we couldn't do 24 months ago? And, again, that's for you to ferret out in today's presentations and the challenge that I would tell you to throw at my colleagues at the breaks and at lunch. Our capabilities are materially better than they've ever been.
 Okay, my vintages slide. If it's true in Asia, let's take a look at it across the Group. Here's in-force IFRS operating profits for the Group. Now we are going up a level.
 In-force, free surplus generation, new business expected free surplus generation. Again, Nic has shown you historically a couple of cohorts of this, but again, this is back to the what you own.
 The emergence of earnings from our relationships with our clients is powerful. It gives us optionality and strength across the cycle that a new entrant doesn't have, someone who mispriced product doesn't have. Again, someone without discipline doesn't have.
 The source of the earnings I showed you at the half-year; that's just the in-force piece. We have other sources of earnings that again have little or no effect by what's going on. And strong currencies. So the resilience again of our capabilities I think is measurable.
 Solvency II. Those of you again that got up at 4 in the morning. 18 years of work; I think the final agreement with the bank was sometime in November. They were very helpful and they did a massive amount of work on their side in getting everything over the line for all these companies for a December announcement.
 And I think the simplest thing -- like I said, I don't want to steal -- Nic is going to go into great detail with you. But we were well-capitalized coming in; we are well-capitalized now.
 We generate a tremendous amount of capital as a Group annually; we've demonstrated that. And, as it turns out, it affects about 10% of our business, which is the -- the with-profits piece you saw from the release. This is an imperfect measurement to measure Prudential, but even that shows our strength.
 Objectives. Wanted to give you a quick update on these. Asia and the free surplus target and IFRS, the year-over-year growth rates, the targets are on -- they are on target. The cumulative underlying free surplus target was intended to be a stretch and is still looking like one.
 One of the questions I got on my travels was: was Asia responsible for FX back to the pound? And we were pretty clear at the time, no; that was never intended. These are local currency, if you will, but you can see the rate and the growth and we are very pleased with the progress towards those.
 Value creation in general. I said this at the half-year, again to repeat myself, I think when you look at these metrics we are competing with ourselves. I don't think we have a peer who has this level of growth of IFRS, of new business profits, and of free surplus generation and, therefore, is paying their dividend from growth.
 If you look at the folks we compete with in our space -- and this goes to relative valuation. Look at 2007 crisis forward, roughly three of our peers are even at an earnings-per-share level that's higher than they were then. We're materially higher than we were them. The growth of our dividend is consistent with the growth of our earnings and our available cash flow.
 That's how it should be; that's where the resilience comes from and again I don't think that's valued high enough in the marketplace. It gives us that countercyclical nature because what we are paying you is what we are earning and the growth in that dividend is coming from the growth in the underlying value of the business, measured. I think it's a key, key element.
 Wrapping it up, my piece, I think the underlying strategy: its indifference, at the very worst, to uncertainty is measurable. For most of the markets we'd like to get in and the consumers we'd like to have relationships with, the uncertainty actually creates more demand. We think the uncertainty changes the behavior of some competitors, probably a little more irrational.
 But we have the right strategy; we are in the right markets; we have the right products and services; we have the right attributes of scale to capitalize on that. And what I hope is over the course of the next somewhere between seven and 10 hours, depending on how many questions you ask, that the team is going to demonstrate that to you.
 The format we are going to have is Nic is going to come up next, give you an update on Solvency II. And at the end of that session we will do Q&amp;A. And at the end of each session we will do Q&amp;A and all of us will be available in any of these to answer questions for you.
 Thank you very much. I want to turn it over to Nic Nicandrou.

 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. 18 years. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In my presentation I will focus on the Solvency II outcome for Prudential following the approval of our methodology and models by the PRA and the implications that this has on the capital management of the Group.
 The analysis that we are presenting today is based on the position of half-year 2015, as this corresponds to our most recent published financial close. An update on the end 2015 Solvency II position will be provided alongside our preliminary results in March.
 I will skip through the cautionary statement and go straight to the next slide which summarizes the key messages that you should take away from my session.
 The first key message is that we have secured PRA approval for all of the applications that we made. In doing so, we have successfully addressed those aspects of the new regime that were most critical to our group. These approvals remove any uncertainty and confirm the strong and resilient capital position of the Group under Solvency II, reinforcing what our other measures of capital already demonstrated.
 We can also confirm that the new regime does not change the capital dynamics of our US and Asia life operations or those of our asset management businesses. This is significant as these businesses contributed over 80% of the Group's free surplus in the first six months of 2015.
 In UK life, where the capital dynamics will be directly impacted by Solvency II going forward, our analysis shows that the net impact of the new regime on both the stock of surplus and the expected future capital flows is relatively modest when compared to the position today. Finally, Solvency II has not introduced any new constraints that don't already exist today, so fundamentally there is no change in the way we think about the strategy of our business, our capital, and our dividend.
 These key messages are very much in line with what we said back in August when I put up this slide to explain how we felt about Solvency II. Clearly, at the time there were a number of key uncertainties which I have highlighted in red text on the slide, such as whether we would receive model approval; in the UK, where would credit and longevity calibrations land, will transitionals be granted and how would they operate; in the US, would RBC continue to apply and based on what level; and in Asia, how much of the extra capital over and above that which is recognized locally, would we be able to include in our overall Solvency II position. We can now provide you with clarity in all of these areas.
 So moving to the detail, as I have already said, we have successfully secured approval for all of the aspects of the Solvency II regime that were most critical to our Group. The various components of the approval process are set out in the top right, which as you can see, were received very close to the go-live date. This is critical because optimizing an outcome can only be done ineffectively when there is both clarity and certainty.
 We applied for and received internal model approval for all of our life operations in the UK and in Asia. In fact, securing full model approval for every Asian life business was critical given the footprint of our Group. Here we are grateful to the PRA's efforts, as I am not aware of any other instance where regulators have granted full internal model approval for operations outside the EU that contributes so significantly.
 Approval was also granted for Jackson to apply RBC and to count surplus in excess of the 250% level. Here the deduction and aggregation rules prevent us from including the diversification benefits between Jackson and the rest of the Group, which are real and sizable.
 The end result of this process is a Group Solvency surplus of GBP9.2 billion at the half-year, equivalent to a ratio of 190%. This amount excludes the surplus held in our with-profit funds as these funds are ring-fenced, the most significant element relating to the UK where we continue to hold a sizable estate. I will come back to this later in my presentation.
 I believe that this is a strong overall outcome, which reinforces what we already know about the Group's capital strength from our other established measures.
 On this next slide I want to take a moment to remind you what this GBP9.2 billion actually represents. It in fact represents the amount of capital that we would hold at the end of one year if a 1-in-200-year stress event, or a combination of such events, occurred in the course of that year. The SCR represents the difference between the base and the stressed capital position.
 To calculate this surplus we had to identify all of the risks that could impact our capital and calibrate each risk to a 1-in-200-year severity level using past experience or expert judgment. Not an easy task, as for many of these risks we don't have a 200-year history, which tends to introduce further caution in the assessment of severity.
 The extreme nature of the standalone stressors for some of these key risks are illustrated in the table on the right. For example, in Asia the equity stresses applied range between minus 58% and minus 72% depending on the market. In the UK interest rate stresses involve a further 108 basis points reduction from the already low current interest rate levels.
 On longevity, the stresses assume that over the next year an event would cause life expectancy to increase for all of our annuitants equivalent to an extra 2.5 years for a 65-year-old male. So the GBP9.2 billion surplus represents the amount of capital that would remain after absorbing the effects of some pretty severe stresses.
 On this next slide I provide a bridge between our previously reported economic capital surplus at the end of 2014 and the half-year 2015 Solvency II position based on the approvals received. The light blue bars in the chart indicate the business-driven movements over the period, which comprise the operating capital generation of GBP0.8 billion; positive market effects in the first half of GBP0.5 billion; the contribution from debt raised in June; and the dividends paid.
 The dark blue bars capture the impact of the approval process, the main item being the GBP1.4 billion of Asian economic capital surplus excluded from the Solvency II result. The impact of all the other changes is modest at minus GBP0.2 billion as their transitional benefit, other changes to own funds, and higher risk calibrations broadly offset. So the key message here is that the outcome of the approval process has produced a Solvency II result which is only GBP0.5 billion lower than what we have previously published, aided in part by the capital-generative nature of our business.
 I have given you some additional color on this next slide of how the movements in the surplus over the six-month period have come through own funds and the SCR. You can see in the third entry down that the excluded Asian surplus is principally a stray deduction from own funds. The combined effect of all the other changes shown in the next line comes through as a GBP2.3 billion benefit to own funds and a GBP2.5 billion increase in the SCR.
 Now, there are many moving parts here, including: higher calibrations for UK longevity impacting both the SCR and the risk margin, increased operational risk charges, changes to dependency assumptions, and allowance for foreign exchange risks, all impacting the SCR; revisions to the matching adjustment, which affect both own funds and the SCR; and the inclusion of transitionals also within own funds. So, many moving parts.
 While the net impact of these changes is small in terms of surplus, when numerator and denominator are increased by similar amounts, then the impact on the ratio is more pronounced. The last line in the table, labeled US Deduction and Aggregation, relates to the way that the PRA have asked us to include Jackson's local solvency within own funds and the SCR, which improves the ratio even though there is no effect on the overall surplus. I will explain why in a later slide.
 I have provided on the left of this next slide the reconciliation between IFRS shareholders' equity and Solvency II own funds at the half-year. The components are the same as those in the equivalent reconciliations that we have previously published. I will, therefore, only comment on those aspects which have changed in some way.
 The first such aspect relates to the fourth line down, which refers to the value of future shareholder transfers from with-profits, which Solvency II allows us to capture within own funds. These now exclude the shareholders' share of the estate of GBP0.7 billion, as the final rules prevented us from taking credit for this item.
 The next line that I would draw your attention to is the one labeled "Risk Margin Net of Transitionals." The risk margin is an additional liability under Solvency II which attaches itself to non-market risks that are non-hedgable. In the UK, transitionals broadly compensate for the effect of the risk margin, but there is no equivalent offset for the risk margin of our Asian businesses, which is what most of the GBP2.8 billion shown relates to.
 The final line that I will comment on is the one labeled, "Liability Valuation Differences." Consistent with our previous approach, this line reflects the additional take credit that we can take in own funds for margins in our technical reserves and for future profits. The amount shown here is now net of the Asia surplus deduction.
 On the right, the pie chart shows the distribution of our Group-wide risks, which confirms what we have previously said: that there is a balanced spread of risks by category with no unduly high concentration in any particular risk type.
 A few words on capital quality, which is summarized on this next slide. The composition of our available resources is dominated by high-quality core Tier 1 capital. Total Tier 1 accounts for 81% of own funds, representing 153% of SCR. There are no restrictions on any of our capital tiers.
 Our two most recent debt instruments totaling GBP1.1 billion were issued on a Solvency II Tier 2 compliant terms with the remaining instruments -- while the remaining instruments have been grandfathered for 10 years. Since our current capital tiers are well within the prescribed limits, we retain significant headroom to increase the capital stack through the issue of qualifying debt. This headroom is in excess of GBP7 billion, GBP3.5 billion of which is in the Tier 2 bucket.
 We have updated the sensitivity of our Solvency II surplus to the usual range of market shocks shown here before the impact of management actions. I would remind you that these represent stresses on stresses, so we are now looking at the outcome of an even more extreme event than 1-in-200.
 The base surplus position of the Group is not compromised under the further-stressed scenario shown, demonstrating the Group's capital resilience under this regime. The sensitivities are more muted than those that we have previously published, reflecting a number of factors including the business evolution in the first half of 2015, the effect of incorporating transitionals, and the fact that the base position now excludes both the shareholders' interest in the estate and a component of Asia surplus. The point here being that, if something is no longer included in the base, then you can't lose it in a shock.
 So, as I have shown you, our Solvency II capital is both high quality and resilient to further market shocks.
 I would now like to cover how the key areas of uncertainties have been successfully addressed and what this means for each business, starting with Asia on this next slide. The significant health and protection bias of our Asian businesses means that the capital surplus under Solvency II is considerably higher than the level recognized under the various local regimes. The extent of this excess is illustrated in the schematic on this slide.
 On the left, I have presented the aggregate local capital position of all of our Asian life businesses at the half-year, sourced from our existing free surplus disclosures. As you can see, our available capital of GBP2.6 billion comfortably covers capital requirements with a net GBP1.4 billion representing the locally-recognized free surplus.
 Solvency II allows us to additionally recognize the value of future profits after a 1-in-200 stress event computed on the prudent Solvency II methodology. Taken together with the local surplus, this calculation produces a Solvency II surplus of GBP6.2 billion for our various businesses in the region. As part of the approval process GBP1.4 billion of this amount, shown in the gray bar, has been excluded from the total, reflecting a prudent regulatory review, leaving Asia with a GBP4.8 billion contribution to the Group's overall position.
 Notwithstanding this deduction, the fact remains that the amount representing the excess of the GBP4.8 billion over the GBP1.4 billion local free surplus does not represent capital that Asian regulators would recognize. It is, therefore, not available to be deployed in the business or to remit to Group. So the effect of the extra recognition of capital under Solvency II and its subsequent partial reduction is of no real consequence to our Asian businesses.
 I have been asked in the past whether a situation can arise where Solvency II -- whether Solvency II approach can somehow constrain or encumber local Asia free surplus and capital flows. The answer to this question is no.
 To illustrate this, why this is true, I have shown you on the right the sensitivity of Asia's GBP4.8 billion surplus to each of our published market stresses. In all cases, the Solvency II surplus would continue to comfortably exceed the more modest local free surplus amount. So the deduction in no way constrains capital movements from Asia in either the base or under stress.
 The local regulatory bases, which are reflected in our existing free surplus disclosures, remain the binding constraint for this business. As a result, our Asian strategy and the way we think about capital consumption, generation, and remittances from the region are all unaffected by Solvency II.
 Moving to the resolution of the key uncertainties relating to Jackson. By receiving approval to continue to use RBC and to take credit for Jackson's surplus in excess of the 250% level, we have maintained the status quo. As a result, there is no change in the way that we think about capital in our US business.
 The schematic on the slide illustrates this. On the far left, I have shown you the components of the local RBC ratio, which expresses total adjusted capital as a percentage of the Company action level. In the middle I show you how the local numbers are brought into our free surplus analysis, which is also the approach that we used to present the end 2014 economic capital result.
 Here, TAC isn't adjusted, but acquired capital is set at 250% of CAL, reflecting the amount of risk capital that we believe to run off the business safely based on a multi-year model. So at the half-year this calculation produced a free surplus for Jackson of $2.2 billion.
 The same $2.2 billion is also included in Solvency II; however, the construct is different. Following IOPA guidance, the PRA have asked that the SCR be set at 150% of CAL. So to achieve the same overall result own funds are then set at TAC, less 1 times CAL.
 The effect of all of this, however, is that we can continue to manage our US business on a local RBC basis with no change to our current free surplus approach. Jackson maintains its strong and resilient RBC ratio and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to successfully manage its capital through various crises over the years. So this part of our business portfolio is also unaffected by the move to Solvency II.
 For completeness, I cover M&amp;G on the right of this slide. M&amp;G is a modest component to our balance sheet- - of our balance sheet and is included based on the current sectoral rules. Therefore, similar to the position for Asia and for Jackson, Solvency II does not affect M&amp;G's strategy or its capital dynamics.
 Now, our UK life entities will need to manage the transition to the new regime, being the only part of the Group that will be directly regulated at a local level on a Solvency II basis. But even here, we have a healthy surplus of GBP3.4 billion in relation to our shareholder-backed business. This surplus excludes the capital that we hold in the UK with-profits fund as it resides in a separate ring-fenced fund.
 As you can see in the middle chart, our UK with-profits fund retains a sizable estate valued at GBP7.2 billion at the half-year on a Solvency II basis, covering its standalone requirements by over 2 times. A large and strong with-profits fund remains strategically important to our UK business.
 The surplus positions of both shareholder and with-profits are in line with those under the outgoing ICAS regime. This is despite the fact that the overall capital resources set aside to cover the SCR and risk margin for annuity business have increased. I illustrate in the top right the severity of these calibrations for both credit and longevity. In relation to the former, credit allowances of 170 basis points per annum are applied, which we estimate are equivalent to roughly 1.5 times the actual default experienced during the 1930's Great Depression.
 On longevity, taking capital requirements and risk margin together, we are allowing for an improvement in life expectancy of around five years for a male age 75. This is more than 3 times the largest increase in industry life expectancy assumptions in any year since 1950. Transitionals mitigate these effects to bring the overall surplus position for our in-force business back in line with ICAS.
 On the right I show the sensitivity of the two components of our UK surplus to further market shocks, which demonstrate their resilience. While we are happy with the surplus positions I've shown, I should add that there are many actions that we can take to increase the UK surplus, should we choose to do so or should we need to do so, and to further improve its resilience. These actions include extending our longevity reinsurance program.
 At the half-year reinsurance covered GBP4 billion of the GBP33 billion of the shareholder-backed annuity liabilities. We could hedge the market risk on shareholder transfers or take action to improve the efficiency of the matching adjustment, which currently applies to 95% of the asset portfolio. So there's GBP1.5 billion to GBP2 billion that we can bring in with further optimization of assets -- in terms of assets.
 Having covered the strength and resilience of the stock of surplus on the previous slide, I now want to turn to the implications of Solvency II on future UK capital flows. We have always been transparent in this area and have regularly disclosed the future expected annual capital generation profiles for all of our businesses based on the free surplus concept.
 On the left I have shown the UK profile that we have previously reported as at the end of 2014, which was based on the Solvency I, Pillar 1 regime. Going forward, we will calculate and report the expected free capital generation profile for the UK based on the Solvency II regime. Our work on this is advanced and we plan to include this information, as at the end of 2015, within our prelims in March.
 Ahead of this, and by way of a taste of, the middle chart shows you the output of this work as at the end of 2014. It depicts how free capital is expected to emerge in the UK life business under Solvency II.
 Now, although the two charts look similar the mechanics underlying each profile are different. For example, the Solvency I profile benefits more from the annual release of prudent valuation margins. This is less so in the Solvency II profile, as most of the valuation margins have already been captured in the stock. Conversely, the contribution to capital from the annual release of the SCR and the risk margin is significantly higher under the Solvency II profile.
 So for Prudential's UK life in-force book these factors, taken together with the annual amortization of transitionals, broadly offset to produce an expected Solvency II free capital generation profile which is very similar to the one under the previous regime. New UK business written from 2016 will not benefit from transitionals, significantly increasing capital intensity at inception for products, particularly products like annuities.
 We have not changed our return hurdles and payback period criteria here, which given the higher capital requirements, these will be more difficult to achieve for annuities unless accompanied by significant financial engineering. I would, therefore, guide you to expect reduced annuity volumes going forward.
 So to summarize on the Solvency II implications for our UK life business, the approvals received produce a strong and resilient surplus position for the two components of our business, both of which are in line with ICAS, the basis that we have used to manage the UK business for over 10 years. Expect that capital generation from the in-force book is not materially different, and you should expect us to continue to apply our strict capital disciplines to the new business opportunities in the market.
 I would now like to move away from the technical Solvency II detail and talk about the extent to which this new regime affects the way we manage capital at Group. This slide summarizes at a high level Prudential's overall approach to capital management. The majority of our capital is held in business operations, where we aim to hold substantial buffers above local requirements.
 This is deliberate, as we want to be in a position to absorb the effects of severe market shocks and still have sufficient capital in each business to pursue our strategy unimpeded. We target high-return, fast-payback opportunities in each market, which means that once a business attains a certain scale it is able to finance its own organic growth from in-force generation and remit cash to Group. Sizable inorganic activity is typically funded by Group.
 We remit an appropriate amount of cash to the center to cover central costs, service centrally-held debt, and pay a progressive dividend. We look to maintain a strong central cash position as this provides us the flexibility to take appropriate risk management actions at the center in a stress, fund business opportunities as they arise, and manage any temporary or unforeseen liquidity constraints in any of our operations.
 At Group, we also seek to ensure that our overall capital level, mix, and quality is appropriate, with an eye to returns and to our financial strength ratings. Solvency II introduces a new parameter to this framework, but given our business footprint -- and that's important -- it is neither more nor less important than all the other features.
 I have said before that operating profitably is the first and most important source of capital for any business. This is exactly what we have done in recent years, as illustrated on this slide by reference to IFRS operating profit, free surplus generation, cash remittances, and operating capital generation on a Solvency I and now on a Solvency II basis.
 This has been achieved by adding a growing level of highly-profitable new business cohorts onto a sizable back book, increasing both our scale and operational leverage. This powerful dynamic differentiates Prudential and, as you have heard from Mike, it is set to continue.
 As you can see on this next slide, over the five-year period to the end of 2014 all of our businesses have contributed significantly to the generation of profits, free surplus, and cash. Indeed, a substantial proportion of these totals has come from those parts of the Group which are not directly impacted by Solvency II.
 Having summarized the past in the previous two slides, let us now turn to the future. As I have already shown you, the introduction of Solvency II does not change the capital dynamics of our life businesses in the US and Asia or those of our asset management operations, such as M&amp;G. In the UK, the application of transitionals moderates the impact of Solvency II on the capital dynamics of the business written up to the end of 2015.
 So given this picture, our free surplus approach, which is based on the local regimes, remains an appropriate way to assess: one, our ability to generate capital in the future; two, our capacity to support new business growth; and, three, assess the quantum of business unit remittances to Group.
 I have reproduced on this slide the expected free surplus generation profiles for all three of our life operations based on the end 2014 position. Solvency II affects only the profile of our UK business, but even here the impact for us is modest for the reasons that I have outlined earlier.
 Taking the three profiles together, the overall effect of Solvency II is not significant. This contextualizes why the new regime does not result in a fundamental change to our capital framework and why, for Prudential, a dividend policy solely anchored on the Solvency II result is not appropriate.
 The Group's dividend philosophy is, therefore, unchanged. We have said before that in making a dividend decision we assess the affordability by reference to a variety of financial metrics and subject these to severe stress events. Solvency II will not change this approach beyond adding another metric to this assessment process.
 I want to take this opportunity to explain how we arrive at our annual dividend decision using the schematic on this slide. It starts with the businesses where we track and manage capital consumption, capital returns and pay back, capital generation, and the effects of any market events. As I have already mentioned, we ensure that each operation maintains sufficient capital buffers on a local basis, enabling it to absorb shocks and still be in a position to pursue its strategy unimpeded.
 In Asia, this translates into holding a healthy buffer over local capital requirements stressed to a 1-in-25 event. In Jackson, we hold a sufficient capital buffer to ensure that we can maintain an RBC ratio in excess of 350% after shocks.
 In the UK, our current intent is to manage the business within a Solvency II target range of 130% to 150%, albeit -- and I repeat this -- this is something that we will keep under review -- and I repeat it is something that we will keep under review. The objective here is to ensure that we have an appropriate buffer to absorb volatility under a further stress.
 Now, in a stress event, 130% would not be a floor. It will be the trigger point for more intensive management actions and remittances to Group would continue unless we came close to breaching the SCR. In general, remittances from business units are informed by the framework that I have just outlined, but also by what we need at Group to cover our commitments.
 Here we manage our liquidity with a view to holding over GBP1 billion in central cash for the reasons that I have outlined earlier. The annual dividend decision is assessed by reference to a number of stock and flow financial metrics.
 If you take IFRS operating profit as an example, we look for the new dividend level to be well covered by the actual IFRS result for the year. We then test, using our financial plans, that future IFRS operating profit can maintain this healthy cover going forward, assuming a 5% per annum dividend increase from this new level.
 We are very mindful of not raising the dividend to a level that is unsafe. In other words, a level that would run the risk of being cut at some point in the future following a market stress, a market shock. We test this by repeating the exact same analysis, this time using the IFRS profit outcomes from a stress set of future financial plans.
 This exercise is repeated for a whole host of KPIs, the most relevant of which are shown on the right, and the entire output of this work then informs the Board's eventual decision. As I have said, Solvency II simply adds another metric to this exercise.
 Okay. Now, I am conscious that I have given you quite a lot of information over the last 35 or so minutes, 40 minutes, which no doubt you will need time to digest. I have repeated my opening slide here, as I don't want to lose sight of the key messages.
 As I said at the start, we are pleased that we have successfully secured approvals for all those aspects of the new regime that were most critical to the Group. These approvals confirmed a surplus position at the half year of GBP9.2 billion, only GBP0.5 billion lower than what we showed you previously, supported by our ability to generate capital on this new basis.
 And remember, this excludes the surplus in the with-profit fund, ignores diversification benefit between Jackson and the rest of the Group and is arrived at after taking a deduction in our Asian Solvency II surplus. These components are sizable, they are real, and are indicative of further underline economic strength and resilience.
 The new regime does not change the capital dynamics of our US and Asian life operations or those of our asset management businesses. This is significant as these businesses generate the bulk of our capital. The UK life business is directly impacted, but the surplus positions are in line with ICAS, the regime on which we have successfully managed this business for over 10 years.
 Future capital generation from UK in-force business is only modestly impacted under Solvency II, even with the transitional amortization. As I have shown you, Solvency II has not introduced any new constraints that don't already exist, so fundamentally there is no change in the way we think about the business strategy, our capital, and our dividend.
 Before I finish I want to say a few words on our credit position, which I know is a topic of interest in the current climate. Shareholders' exposure to credit is concentrated in the UK annuity portfolio and the US general account, mainly attributable to Jackson's fixed annuity business. These portfolios remain high quality and are defensively positioned with a low exposure to securities below investment grade. Credit exposure is well diversified and we operate strong risk management controls on concentration risk with strict limits by geography, sector, and individual security.
 Since the 2008/2009 credit crisis, we have taken a conscious decision to trade yield for quality. As a result of this approach, 96% of our US and 98% of our UK debt portfolios are investment grade, the healthiest position we have enjoyed since the last crisis. With no defaults and minimal impairments, credit performance has been positive.
 We have updated the disclosures on our exposure to oil and gas that we first provided with our 2014 year-end results and I have included these in the appendix to my slides. Chad will expand on the US credit position for this sector in his presentation, but in overview, our exposures are well contained, are properly diversified, and focused on high-quality names.
 In my final slide, I will cover four reporting items of note. The first is that going forward we will provide a Solvency II update on a six-monthly basis alongside our half- and full-year results. These updates will contain a similar level of information as the ones that were included in today's R&amp;S.
 The second is that we will retain our EEV and free surplus reporting, as we believe they continue to have an important role in our suite of financial metrics. We will, however, evolve the UK components of these metrics to capture the implications of Solvency II. This change will be fully embedded in our reporting at half-year 2016, but we will provide additional memorandum information and analysis on this with the 2015 preliminary results.
 We are also announcing today that going forward we will not produce first- and third-quarter interim management statements. Finally, starting in 2016, instead of proposing a final dividend alongside the year-end results, the Board will declare a second interim dividend.
 To be clear, we will be moving from an interim and a final dividend to twice interim approach, in common with some of our FTSE peers. This will have no impact on time or quantum of dividends. It's purely a technical change.
 With that I will now hand you back to Mike.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, the first of the Q&amp;A sessions. Again, we are going to get into tremendous detail, as you see by the deck in front of you, of the various business units, but we wanted to take a quick pause here before the break and answer any questions on the first session if you'd like.
================================================================================
Questions and Answers

Unidentified Company Representative   [1]

 [State] your firm's name and then fire away in terms of questions and wait for the microphone.

 Jon Hocking,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions; I'm afraid all on Solvency II.
 So the first question: I appreciate that the Solvency II framework has no real impact on the dividend flow apart from the UK business, but you are applying an internal model for the Group and also for the Asian units, as you said. I just wonder how the use test manifests itself.
 You are actually using this model, presumably, to steer the business in some way. You mentioned UK and US; just wonder if there are any behavioral changes that you can point to from actually using Solvency II models. First question.
 Second question, the restriction to the own funds in Asia, the GBP1.3 billion that Nic mentioned, is that just a pro rata of the entire Asia own funds, or is that one specific territory or a couple of territories that you couldn't get approval for? And then, finally, I just wondered if you could put a dollar value on the UK transitionals, please. Thank you.

 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shall I --? So use test, given the footprint of the Group and given actually the way the approvals are panned out, where it ends up mattering most is in relation to the UK. Of course, as I said, this is an additional lens so when making pricing decisions, when looking at product decisions in all parts of the Group, we will look at it through a Solvency II lens. More relevant in Asia.
 But, no; you referenced that it impacts things at the margin but not that dramatically outside the UK.
 The restrictions are effectively pro rata. It's not focused on any particular market. It is applied to a percentage of the own funds, and as we move forward, we have agreed a formula with the PRA and as we move forward you should expect that deduction to effectively, broadly move in line with -- in sync with the growth of the business and the contribution that that business makes to the overall surplus.
 And on the dollar amount or sterling amount on transitionals, look, for me it's not the amount that matters. What matters most is what does it mean; what is its impact? Which is where I focused my presentation today.
 As regards stock, the PRA is on the record, both last July but also last Friday, as saying that this is good capital. It's core Tier 1 capital. It's capital that we can rely on in terms of making our dividend decisions. And actually it's quality; it's no different to any other type of capital that we have. So, it doesn't really affect -- its existence does not affect the way the regulator or we think about the quality of our stock.
 Now, as I appreciate that it's relevant in relation to flows, because it is a benefit that will amortize over a 16-year period in a straight line, which is why we worked hard to accelerate our work, notwithstanding all the uncertainty on trying to show you and give you the detail as to -- on the Solvency II profile, in terms of capital generation going forward and to reassure you that, notwithstanding that there is a depreciation, the impact is de minimis and very manageable.
 So really don't be focused on its size; we are not. We are focused on what does it mean and, as we've shown you, the effects are third-order.

 Blair Stewart,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Stewart, BofA Merrill. Just two questions. Firstly, does the exclusion of the shareholders' share of the estate impact the way you might think about the estate in the future? And is that a final ruling? Is that something you hope to get some movement on over time?
 And, secondly, with regards to the capital structure of the Group, you mentioned that you've got significant debt capacity. I wonder what you are thinking around that in terms of the capital structure of the Group. And if I could just add a third question, sorry. What is your feeling about where the Solvency II numbers might have gone as at the full year, Nic? Just a qualitative assessment, please.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you for those questions, Blair. The exclusion of the shareholders' share is frustrating because it's real. It's something that, even though we can't access it until we distribute the estate, were we ever to do so -- and as I said, it's frustrating.
 We went backwards and forwards on that with the PRA and, interestingly, it is something that we were previously allowed to count in the ICAS regime. And of course, we bring it into our EEV.
 It is a final ruling. The only way that that could change; the only way that we can bring this in to the shareholder is to effectively distribute the estate and crystallize it. But it's not without benefit, because that GBP0.7 billion, or at least GBP0.7 billion less the risk capital attaching to that GBP0.7 billion, is included in the -- as part of the surplus in the with-profit fund. So it's not lost entirely from the numbers that I have shown you; it's simply no longer captured in the Group number of GBP9.2 billion or the UK number of GBP3.4 billion.
 Capital structure, debt capacity; I think, look, we are broadly happy with the structure that we have today. Regulatory mix is not the only thing that we look at when thinking about our capital. We have regard to the cost of the capital and that influences the decisions about mix.
 We also have regard to what the rate -- to the impact of the debt on the rating agency position, because the reading agencies will often apply different set of criteria and give us different amount of credit for each instrument. And of course, ultimately, this is capital that we have to service and it does impact our interest cover ratio. So there's a whole variety of factors which go into the mixer. And where we are is broadly where we would like to be, but it's good to know that there is that significant capacity should we ever need to tap into it.
 Full-year 2015, we just haven't run those numbers. We will do so alongside our year-end results, which we will present in March.
 What can I say in anticipation of that? You've heard me talk before many times about the capital-generative ability of our business. You saw that in the previous disclosures that we have given you. You saw the number at the half-year, so clearly that will remain.
 It's not evenly distributed in a year, so you could double what we showed you, but -- that may be a way of doing it. There were market effects, particularly in Q3, that will have impacted the solvency position and my expectation is that those market effects would have effectively unwound the benefit that we got in the first half that I have shown you on the slide. So more capital generation offset by a slight unwinding of that positive that we saw in the first six months.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James Shuck,  UBS - Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James Shuck, UBS. I had three questions, please. Firstly, on the sensitivities you show in the Solvency II ratios, could use help me understand a little bit the insensitive nature, both to equity markets -- you show a 20% fall has about 1 point impact on the ratio and in particular to credit spreads. Because with nearly half of your SCR deriving from credit spread risk I would have expected the sensitivity to be far more sensitive than you are showing there.
 The second question is on the RBC ratio. I'm just interested to know -- and it may seem a long way away, but if US rates do rise, could you just talk to how the RBC ratio actually responds to a higher interest rate environment, please?
 And then, thirdly, I see the sensitivities you give on slide 11 for Asia in terms of the actual impact on the surplus. Could you just talk a little bit about the sensitivity of new business to things like slowdown in GDP growth, lower equity markets, that sort of stuff?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. So, equity sensitivity, not too significant, largely because the US position is strongly hedged to a minus 20, so that's what drives that. We also do have some hedging in place. We have hedged part of the equity risk in the shareholder transfer in the past and, therefore, those two elements give us an element of protection on that particular metric.
 Credit spreads are not that significant in the way that they come through the calculation. What hits us, which is actually the real economic position, is if these were to ever become defaults. So the movement in spreads is not a feature of the RBC regime.
 In the UK, the matching adjustment and the way that operates means that, as spreads widened, the fundamental spread or the amount of credit for that spread that we contain moves broadly in sync. So that was exactly what the matching adjustment was designed to immunize, such that you are then left with only having to bear a hit if that ever converts into a default.
 The impact on the RBC ratio of movements in the UK interest rate rises, I think maybe I can ask Chad to comment on that either now -- I don't know if we have a mic -- or maybe later in his session.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So the question was on RBC and interest rates, is that correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So, because the statutory regime is on a book value basis, the asset side of the balance sheet is not going to mark, so it will be held at book. So the interest rates are not going to impact the surplus position.
 The largest impact we would see really is, as rates move up, we would get some relief on the VA reserving. So we would actually see some modest capital benefit overall in the RBC, but it would also depend on where the starting point is with the overall VA reserves. So a small reserve we are not going to get much relief; a large reserve we will get more relief.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And on impact on GDP new business, this isn't the risk that is explicitly modeled. There are -- whilst SCR captures 99-point-something-percent, what it doesn't capture things like the impact that our strategy may have on the RBC. And really your question really -- changes to GDP behaviors, what that might do for new business is not explicitly included there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson, KBW. Three quick questions. One is, on the capital topic, a question I'm getting asked quite often is the Hong Kong orphan estate -- I assume now the local Hong Kong regime still applies in terms of your thinking -- and the rapid growth you've had in your PAR business. At what point or how many years of that growth can that estate finance before it starts burning through on to the shareholders' funds?
 Then the second question is a lot of the Asian regulators have look at Solvency II and want to mimic it. And I think to Hong Kong, I think some of those back-to-back PAR products they would be hurt under the Solvency II regime, so I wonder if you can just talk about Asian, so I wonder if you can just talk about Asian --.
 And then third question, and it's for Mike, you mentioned -- and maybe it's a bit sneaky and you might have a no comment on this one, but you mentioned that some of your competitors in Asia are trying to ramp up using possibly irrational parameters. I was wondering to what extent your biggest competitor is doing that, or is it some of the European, smaller European, US ones who are --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Do you want me to get Mark on the phone?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -- being disruptive? No, no, no. (laughter) I'm sure he'll respond so --.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Hong Kong estate. There is an estate in Hong Kong, clearly following their domestication. On a Solvency II basis, as on a local basis, that estate is about GBP1.3 billion. But because it's in a ring-fenced funds -- and the SCR against that is around 0.8.
 But because it's in a ring-fenced fund, yes, I haven't reference it -- trust me, there are so many other pockets of economic capital. I haven't reference them all; I've just given you the big ones. But there is more economic capital they are; we just can't bring it into the overall group position.
 As regards the ability of that estate to finance future growth, it's significant. A) because the number is sizable and, of course, it appreciates in value on the returns that we get, but more importantly, because the team have done a phenomenal job on actually getting the products that we sell there to be very capital light. So the growth that you've seen us report in the third quarter has not, in any way, reduced or used up chunks of that estate.
 And the fact that, as I was saying, at the half-year it's GBP1.3 billion, when the amount that we transferred across was GBP1.1 billion, GBP1.2 billion, just goes to show that.
 Asian regulation moving to risk-based. That's really interesting. That's a really interesting topic. And you are right; whether it is Singapore, whether it's Hong Kong, China is increasingly talking in fact with [Siros]. They are moving to effectively risk-based capital regimes and those are tailwinds for the solvency position of our Asian businesses. Why? Because of health and protection.
 And just to explain why that is, the risk-based regimes will allow us to calculate the liabilities of a health and protection product, taking into account future flows: premiums that we will receive less claims. When you do that sum you come up with what you would call a negative reserve. Under the existing regimes you those are [zero-ized]. But under a risk-based regime you get value for it, which is why we have value for it in Solvency II.
 Now the really interesting thing is as these regimes move to a risk-based capital, they will begin to recognize that locally. So, we have an interest, and we are pursuing it, to push EU to extend its assessment of equivalents to places like Hong Kong, to places like China, and to places like Singapore. Because if the solvency position of those countries is higher as these regimes get introduced, and they are deemed equivalent or they are assessed as equivalent, then we can recognize additional profit.
 The question that I put to the PRA, were that to happen, how would you think about the deduction that you've applied? And they've claimed the fifth on that. They said, well, we will come to that position when that situation eventually emerges. But it's potentially a positive as we move forward and you've seen glimpses of the extent of that positive through the combined numbers that we provided you in relation to Asia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And, Greig, on the Asian competitors, I guess I will leave it for Tony's panel later in detail. But I would tell you just traveling the region fairly extensively, what you see is inconsistency in pricing and behavior of some of the smaller players. So you'll see a market where you'll see something that seems irrationally priced and the next market we'll be in that same firm will seem to have reasonable pricing, or -- and I think that balances again goes to a lot of different factors about their models.
 I think you'll find that we are pretty disciplined across the region in how we price and how we look at expectations on return and some of the metrics we've discussed this morning. So, I will let you work through the individual competitors and we are going to do it by country later in the event today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes, Macquarie. A couple questions, if I could about the Asian VIF credit that you are getting in the free surplus definitions you are using. So I've noticed you've not changed the free surplus definition for Asia, which obviously is going to lag the VIF credit, so when you write new business in Asia it's going to give you, presumably subject to contract boundaries, a boost to your Solvency II capital position.
 Now, obviously that's going to be much greater than you see from the actual strain you are incurring locally in Asia, which means your GBP4.8 billion that you've got of VIF in Asia credits for Solvency II you'd expect to grow over time as the new business comes in. So I guess my question is, given you can't use that locally in Asia, why are you taking a business unit approach to the UK? Because the only place you can use that Solvency surplus is in the UK.
 Or does -- as that (inaudible) grow your target range for solvency increase? What is the target range? I can't actually see it in the presentation, by the way. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, as we write new business, particularly of a health and protection nature in Asia, given its underlying profitability, a better value increases. You have seen that come through. And the credit, even though it's done on a Solvency II method, using stress as the credit should also come through in the Asia's contribution to the Solvency II result.
 The point of this, though, is that it has no real consequence because it's not capital, as I said earlier, that the local regulators would recognize. And, therefore, it's not -- I can't call it free or excess capital that I have that we can deploy in any particular way; in the same way, for example, as if it was locally recognized.
 Which is part of the reason why we haven't -- unlike many of our Europeans, and given the footprint of our business, not given you a ladder of what is the range that we want to operate. The number -- it depends where that capital comes from. If it's Asia -- if Asia was to magically double in the course of the next 12 months and the GBP4.8 billion that we brought in was to become GBP9.6 billion, the ratio would improve substantially.
 So what? Short of selling the businesses, or short of doing some sort of VIF monetization profile, I can't do anything with that capital. And it's not something that -- the VIF monetization or selling the businesses is not in sync with our strategy. We will be giving value away and clearly contrary to our strategy. So it isn't helping us.
 In the US, yes, if it improves the -- if the RBC ratio is stronger, we will have a stronger excess and that can be brought back to Group and, etc., and similarly the UK. If we operate comfortably above the range that I've indicated, then that would indicate that we can bring more back.
 So it depends where it's coming from. That's why I'm agnostic, if you like, as to where this ratio at the Group level gets to at the top end. And to a degree, whilst I'm agnostic where it gets to at the bottom end, unless of course it gets to a range where it's a real risk of breaching the SCR.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (inaudible) use the reinsurer or some of this business into the UK to support a lower-than-100% ratio on the UK business under Solvency II, benefiting from some of the --. You see what I'm trying to say?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Are there opportunities we can -- out there to think about either moving capital or moving risk from one jurisdiction to the other to optimize that? There are.
 Of course, in a [GSI] type environment that is not without its consequence, because it does increase the interdependencies that we have between the businesses. The GSI drives you effectively to have businesses that are not -- or penalizes those interdependencies. So, yes, there are opportunities we can do that in relation to Solvency II, but it could potentially have adverse consequences downstream as we move to GSI in the interdependency charges that we may end up having to carry.
 I don't believe we need to do it. I said it's GBP9.2 billion. I think it's a strong overall position, for all the factors that I have outlined, yes. But there are -- as I said, there are opportunities to do things.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Two questions. First is just on the credit sensitivity. You used to show that credit sensitivity including rating migration for the UK. Have you removed that or have you just been shortening your words?
 And, secondly, on credit sensitivity. You talk about a 10 times default assumption in the States. What is your existing default assumption?
 And then moving on from that, on your dividend slide you have a rather tantalizing little clock showing somewhere between 1.9 and 2.5 times cover as being the pale green area. So I wondered if you just wanted to expand on that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Dividend clock, that was illustrative, but I will expand on that.
 Rating migration is not in the sensitivity. Just to give you -- actually, the 1-in-200 stress for rating migration in the UK is equivalent to half the portfolio effectively being downgraded in one year. So that's how severe, if you like, the base position is.
 As I said, we haven't included it; it wouldn't point to a different picture. We can consider doing that next time.
 The default assumption in the US, it's what we incorporate in our IFRS reporting. We show you an RMR based on historic experience. For the debt portfolio that we have in the US, that's 25 basis points, so effectively it's 10 times that.
 The dividend, that was illustrative. I said we use -- I wanted to make the point that we don't just use the base and the actual covers. A number of you have talked to us before to say, look, your dividend is so healthily covered by the IFRS profit. It's 2.5 times at the end of 2014; why don't you draw down on cover?
 It's a legitimate question. The way we think about that isn't just effectively the spot number; it's to look at what would happen in a stress and this is what we do. We take a 1-in-25 combined stress and we say what would have happened if our IFRS profits were to experience a 1-in-25 event and what would the new -- the cover be on that event? Which is what the two dials are meant to represent.
 And if those effectively are in a good zone, then -- and of course we then have similar dials, not only for the other metrics, but for year one of our plan, year two of our plan, year three of our plan. So we have all these things. The Board gets lots of dials and we see where they all sit and then we make our dividend decision.
 The reason we have that second aspect is because we don't ever want to be in a position to cut the dividend. So in a stress we want to continue to grow it by at least 5%, which is why we do what we do. So that's what that little schematic was meant to represent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Charles Catlett,  Thane Robinson - Analyst   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [Charles Catlett], [Thane Robinson]. Nic, could you give us an update on G-SIFI, the timeline and potential impact? I know it's early days. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2019 and there is quite a lot of water that will need to run under the bridge before 2019. It's progressing. There is -- clearly, we now have a BCR; the backstop capital requirement is not significant. It's not a constraint for us or any of the G-SIFIs. It's -- that backstop capital requirement is equivalent to around 70% of the SCR.
 Of course, that will get scaled up and they've already been clear that they will do that to bring that BCR backup to SCR. And then, depending on the nontraditional noninsurance, there will be an additional factor on top of that.
 What is outstanding is what exactly is -- what precisely is nontraditional noninsurance going to be and what factors would you need to apply depending on a number of criteria, not least the component that is NTI, or indeed some other factor such as interdependencies. We are still some way away from getting to a position. Interestingly, the BCR for US businesses has been set up 150. Of course it will be scaled up, but it's not at a level that is going to suddenly present us with a surprise, a significant surprise downstream.
 So, 2019. We still have some way to go. At the same time, you do have the International Capital Standards, the ICS, that is, at the moment, working slightly separately. It's designed to apply to the 50 largest multinational insurers, and again that is on a different basis. There are exchanges at the moment between the IAS, who is leading on that piece of work, and ourselves and others to help inform their thinking.
 All these things will eventually converge. As I said, we are some years away. At this stage we are not seeing anything that is fundamentally threatening. And at the end of the day, as we've said earlier, we are a business; whichever lens you want to apply to us that generates capital.
 As I said, the first and most important source of capital is operating profitably. This is what you've seen us do and that will continue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Abid Hussain,  Societe Generale - Analyst   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Abid Hussain, Soc Gen. I've got three questions if I can. First, on the US RBC. Can you just talk about the change in methodology for equivalents from when you last published? It looks like it gave you around a 7% boost to the solvency ratio.
 The second question is on the UK and on annuities. You said that we should expect lower volumes going forward, so to my mind, would it just be simpler to run the UK business off and maximize the cash generation there?
 And the third question is on Asia. On your 2017 IFRS earnings target of GBP1.9 billion, how comfortable are you with that target?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so the RBC change in methodology, it's a numerator/denominator play. What we had in the -- when we published the full-year 2014, we mirrored what we had in our free surplus thinking, which is to keep the numerator the same and have a denominator that's 2.5 times.
 All we've done is shifted the components. So it doesn't change anything; it's just optical. If that's your question.
 And actually this gives me the opportunity to make another point, which is I know the market cares a lot, but we are relatively unemotional about the ratio. We tend to look at it more in terms of surplus. Why?
 Because as you've seen, it's a little arbitrary -- the RBC is a good example -- as to what you put in the numerator and what you put in the denominator. Here something has happened to shift it positively by 7 points, but nothing has changed in substance, which is why you have seen me put a lot of the sensitivities on the actual pounds/billions rather than be emotional about the ratio. And there is other things that you can do to effectively move the two in sync and it's optical.
 UK annuities. Look, it is possible if the market pricing was to move substantially, if you went after higher yielding assets or if you did extensive longevity reinsurance, to kind of make the thing work. It is possible, but it's a lot of financial engineering to deliver the outcome.
 And, candidly, when it's only contributing -- and really we are talking about bulks. When this is contributing less than 1.5% at the half-year of our IFRS profits, it's a lot of work when we can deploy that capital more usefully elsewhere in Asia, indeed in the US and deliver higher returns. I'm not saying we are not going to do it, but relative to the volumes, we did GBP1.8 billion of bulks last year, GBP1.5 billion roughly at the third quarter this year. I just don't see us sustaining those levels as we move forward.
 I don't think the UK is in runoff. You shouldn't interpret it as that. You will hear later on from both John and Aki the opportunities that we have elsewhere. The with-profit fund is a vibrant fund, that's why the strength in its solvency position is supercritical for us.
 I know it's not sexy and I know it's not that exciting, because ultimately the profits drip feed through as opposed to the simply turn up on year one, which is what's made bulks an interesting thing. But it's real, it's sustainable, it's resilient, and it's coming. And you will see that in Aki's presentation.
 As to the IFRS numbers, you tell me what the FX rates will be in 2017 and I will tell you what the number will be. The point that Mike was making is that we are not asking the Asia business to deliver a sterling amount. We are asking them to grow compound by 15%, at least 15%, on the local currencies and that's exactly what they've been doing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik Musaddi,  JPMorgan Cazenove - Analyst   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik Musaddi, JPMorgan. Just a couple of questions. On the roll-forward from IFRS to Solvency II, you showed a number called value of future shareholder transfer of GBP3.4 billion. Can you just give us more thoughts on what that number is?
 Is it like VIF, because there is a separate line called liability valuation difference, so what that GBP3.4 billion number is? Is it coming from just UK, US? Any thoughts on geographical split as well?
 Secondly, on annuities, UK bulk annuities. You are kind of guiding that don't expect a lot of volumes. Is it because the margins are going below 10% ROE, or is it single-digit ROE, or you are still not ready to accept, let's say, a low double-digit ROE?
 What's the difference here? How much is the change in the ROE recently because of Solvency II? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shareholder transfers. You are right; it is akin to a valuation margin. We could have put the two together, but -- with the GBP9 billion, but we decided to show it separately because, if anything --.
 So what does it represent? It is effectively the one-ninth share of the bonuses that we will be declaring going forward to our with-profit policyholders. So the numbers are -- of the GBP3.4 billion, around GBP2.3 billion is in the UK; the rest is in relation to the one-ninth of the bonuses or whatever the relevant percentage is in the various countries for Asia. And most of that is in Hong Kong.
 Annuities. We've never looked at it by reference to margins. I know it's a simplistic thing to do. Margins is not a good measure. It sort of profits over APEs, it's not that interesting for all the reasons that we've rehearsed in the past. It doesn't tell you about the capital that you have to put behind the business. It doesn't tell you anything about payback, which is how we've looked at it.
 The capital requirements, if you don't have transitionals, are much higher you. So the denominator that comes into that calculation, if you are running the business by reference to return on capital, and the period it takes to pay back that capital is elongated.
 If we can do it in a way -- and we haven't changed our hurdles. If we can do it in a way that allows us to deliver what we've been able to count under the previous regime and what we can achieve elsewhere, then we will do it. But I just don't think -- I'm not putting a lot of pressure on the business to do a lot of it, i.e., we have other opportunities.
================================================================================
Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning. I am here today with the team from PCA to give you an update on our businesses in Asia, a set of businesses we are incredibly proud of.
 Joining me today, our Chief Financial Officer, Adrian O'Connor, who I believe many of you have met. Ms. Lilian Ng, the new Chief Executive of Insurance in Asia replacing me.
 Along with Lilian is our new COO of Insurance, Azim Mithani, who you may not have met. Azim is a real Prudential journeyman, having served with distinction for over two decades in India, Malaysia, UK and now Hong Kong.
 From Eastspring we have Chief Executive Guy Strapp and his deputy Miss Michele Bang.
 Given the keen interest in our Hong Kong business, which has been doing quite well, we brought along the team. I will leave it to Mr. Derek Yung, our Chief Executive of Prudential Hong Kong, who in my mind is the best Chief Executive of Insurance operating in the Hong Kong market. Derek will introduce his team to you later.
 Well, clearly the start to 2016 could not have been more volatile, but this does not in any way distract us from the significant opportunity in front of us in Asia.
 The current projection from the IMF says that by 2020 Asia's economies would increase by the size of the current German and Italian economies combined. Even if the growth rate is 3% it would still be equivalent to adding an economy the size of France over the next five years. And whilst GDP seems to have been bouncing around quite a bit, one cannot refute the direction of growth.
 You have heard us talk over the years about the emerging middle-class, which is our customer sweet spot, which continues to grow. Mike talked about this earlier, so I won't belabor what you already know.
 Context, this is a complicated and dynamic region, but I am confident that we will continue to go from strength to strength. Why? Because we've operated businesses in the region for over 100 years across 14 different countries and in doing so have developed significant comprehension and competence.
 Today we are well-positioned in countries that will deliver the majority of this future economic growth. We do not need to at this stage enter new markets in Asia to be able to win.
 What does all this translate into? There is nothing groundbreaking here. These charts reflect the unquestionable opportunities for our industry in Asia. I am sure you have all seen this before. To quantify the opportunity here, well, with an actuary for a wife I have to back up everything with numbers, that can be interesting.
 It is estimated that the mortality gap alone can generate new business premiums of US$170 billion annually. Just capturing a small piece of that you can imagine how that translates into new business profits.
 And whether it is capturing the mortality or morbidity gaps through our health and protection expertise, or liberating the huge cash deposits with our unique bank assurance skills and Eastspring asset management, we could not be better positioned to win.
 The great news is the local governments and regulators, with whom we have deep and long-term relationships, understand these exposures and are keen to work with us and the industry to provide solutions for their people. Their people, our future and existing customers.
 So the opportunity is clear, but are we where we need to be? No one else can paint this picture on the scale we have. It is the beauty of our platform which enables us to produce PCA's durable performance, the diversification of geography, distribution and product.
 We don't pretend one size fits all. There is no one blueprint, no single standardized solution, you have got to know what you are doing to be successful in the region. We developed, again, significant competency and you will see great examples of that throughout the morning from the team.
 While the portfolio is well-established, it has and will continue to flex. 10 years ago our biggest insurance businesses were Korea and Taiwan. Let's not do that again. Five years ago it was Indonesia. Today it is Hong Kong. This is the beauty of our business model, diversified and flexible, focused on execution and it has tripled the APE and AUM from 2005 to 2014.
 Eastspring has been a great partner to the life business and has been rapidly growing its third-party business too. Earlier you saw the significant savings opportunity, Mike also talked about this. The two-pronged complementary approach through life and asset management makes perfect sense to us and it has been working well.
 So we are in the right place, we have a great platform, but do we have access? By 2020 there will be close to 2 billion middle-class in Asia, 2 billion, and today we only have 14 million customers. I will let the numbers do the talking in terms of how we can reach this audience in a manner unparalleled.
 And while the insurance business continues to grow on a daily basis we have already recruited 200 new agents since we have been up here this morning.
 Eastspring hasn't exactly been standing still. Eastspring has now become the largest Asia ex-Japan retail onshore asset manager. It is a powerhouse in the making. And Guy and Michele will give you more color on this shortly.
 So we have a distribution reach that continues to grow, but you have got to have the products to solve solutions. Knowing what the markets and the customers need and providing solutions at the right time through the right distribution channels and having the humility to learn from your mistakes has really made us successful. There is just a few examples here.
 Hong Kong, we have redefined the construction and the delivery of PAR products, the team will go through that later. Indonesia, our linked protection products really work. People like the flexibility and choice all-in-one package. In Singapore our PRUshield, a health insurance plan that vertically integrates beautifully with the government scheme, has become the market leader.
 Similarly with Eastspring, spotting a gap in the dividend play in Japan and delivering the solution in a timely manner has propelled one of Eastspring's Japan funds to being the market leader.
 Whether it is insurance or asset management one has to operate with a very clear understanding of product, distribution, customer alignment and then maintain an obsession of managing product life cycles. This is precisely why we invented the product innovation index. Again, the teams will give you more color on that in a moment.
 Those of you who know me well know I like to compete, but you can't compete if you don't keep score. And this is just a handful of some of our metrics. Our financial results big for themselves and Adrian will go through them in a moment in great detail. But I would ask you to focus on for now one box, the upper right-hand box, people.
 You have heard me say this before, there are two raw materials in this business, capital and talent, and we could not be where we are today without a relentless focus on talent attraction, development and retention. You heard our Chairman talk about this last night at dinner.
 In fact, for us, talent management is and has been for many years a measured [bonusable] KPI in all our businesses. We wouldn't be where we are today without the best people in the business and we are very fortunate to have our Chief Human Resources Officer here, Miss Jolene Chen, who from my perspective is the best people practitioner in the business.
 I am a little bit concerned about the second bullet of 93%. I would like to talk to the 7% who don't seem to understand Jolene. Anyway, let me just pause for a second and step back and let you hear from some of our associates from around Asia.
 (Video playing)
 Well, Manny Pacquiao may have lost the fight of the century, or could be past his prime, but PCA is certainly not and we will not lose.
 It would be natural for us on the life side after 24 quarters of consecutive double-digit growth, that is six years, and being one of the largest asset managers now in Asia, it would be easy for us to sit back and pat ourselves on the back. But from my perspective, as the Chief Executive of PCA, we have not even begun to scratch the surface.
 We have a duty to exploit this opportunity to help our customers, our staff, our partners, our communities and our shareholders. Thank you. I will pass it to Adrian.

 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you very much, Tony. Good morning, everybody. It has been my privilege now for quite a number of years now to tell the story of PCA's financial success. The themes are focused on management and delivery of our financial metrics revolving around value, profits and cash.
 What drives delivery? I am not going to make any apologies or any excuses forcing the following, and I'm going to repeat it -- we create value by selling volumes of profitable business. And as Mike and Tony have already said, that focus has been on regular premium business and protection. I have said it before and I will say it again, that is where our focus has been through this journey we have had.
 Secondly, we turn that value into profits and cash by protecting that value and then turning into profits and cash by focusing and managing PEC, persistency, expenses and claims. That has been the recipe, that has been the recipe for quite a period now. That is on the insurance side.
 We have now become material on Eastspring, the fund side; it is now making up almost 10% of IFRS profits. Growing funds under management is key to driving revenue and the three sources of that growth are: our captive insurance funds, mainly PCA; net retail flows; and obviously the one that we can't control, the moves in the markets.
 I'm going to talk about financials today, as I always do. Financials are [outputs]. And I'm going to turn back to what Tony said. The key ingredients for delivery are the passion, the energy, the focus, the discipline of our people, that is key, of our distributors and of our management teams.
 And I am delighted that today you will actually see one of our management teams in action to really tell you the story. As I say I am talking about numbers. But the real story is about the people who drive that.
 Okay, what am I going to talk about today? What is on the agenda? Last year I talked about embedded value and free service generation and the relationship between the two. Today it is going to be exclusively on IFRS profits. And I'm going to demonstrate the robustness and resilience of those profits.
 So, I will start off by just talking about the overall growth in the scale of the business, which Mike has alluded to earlier on. Then I will talk about IFRS profits at the PCA level. Then I'll dig a little bit deeper looking at Eastspring first of all, then looking at the life businesses. And then dig even a little bit deeper and look at Indonesia and Hong Kong as examples. And then wrap it all up.
 So let's talk about scale. So I've got four metrics that I look here in terms of scale, and scale is the enforce business, top left is the value of the in-force, top right life reserves bottom left life weighted premium and bottom right Eastspring funds under management.
 The way I look at this is life -- value of in-force really talks about how much capacity you have with your future earnings, whereas I see life reserves and life weighted premiums, the growth in those, really are a proxy for the growth in IFRS profits on the insurance side [I'd say] certainly at the first order. And then Eastspring funds under management, growth there is really of first-order - the growth of the IFRS profits of Eastspring.
 Now as you can see, we've seen dramatic growth in all of those numbers since 2004. Factor 10 for VIF, factor of 6 for life reserves, factor of 5 for life weighted premium, and factor of 4 for funds under management -- dramatic growth over that period. And since 2010 they have all doubled.
 So scale has grown. Why has scale grown? On the life side, and Mike said it, it is all about regular premium, layer after layer after layer of regular premium. And as Tony said, we have had 24 months of year-on-year growth. That is what drives the numbers and it is profitable growth.
 As you can see, our growth in new business has tracked at slightly better than tracked or AP, so we have retained the margin as well. So that is what it's all about, just layer after layer after layer.
 On the funds side we have grown our funds under management 2012 to half year 2015 from GBP46 billion to GBP85 billion. Basically split into three bits all roughly equal, our third-party flows one-third, flows from Asia Life and other group including UK and US one-third, and then market movements one-third.
 But the really big news is the growth in net flows over the last two years. You saw in 2013 GBP1.4 billion, that jumped up in 2014 to GBP5.4 billion. As you know, at the end of the half year last year GBP4.5 billion. And even with the market volatility grew in the third quarter last year.
 Okay let's look at IFRS the PCA -- profits at the PCA level. Very quickly looking at this graph, just shows the split between life and Eastspring and the growth rates. Now I said earlier we would turn value into profits by managing PEC. That is a demonstration that we have done it because we have seen the growth rates already.
 Now looking at -- again at the PCA level, the sources of those profits and this includes Eastspring. You have seen some of these numbers before, but they didn't include Eastspring. And I'll highlight the three biggest numbers.
 The light blue, the 52%, which is the one that we love most which is the life insurance profits, the difference between what we get in charges for insurance or protection and what we actually pay out in claims. we like that because it is stable and we have control. We have control over pricing, underwriting on the way in and underwriting on claims.
 The second piece, biggest piece is in red. That is the fee income that Eastspring gets from both the captive insurance and its retail business.
 Third piece is the 12% the darker blue, that is the fee income in our [IOP] business which now amounts to about GBP16 billion that the insurance business takes over and above what it pays to Eastspring.
 Those three in total add up to 80% of our profits. So significant and it is the stuff we like, in fact this is stuff we love.
 And in completion, as I said previously, we get -- the rest of it comes from PAR business, non-PAR business, mainly that is spread business, and shareholder funds.
 And just to complete the picture and make sure that you all have your reconciliations sorted out in terms of total profits, there are expenses, the total expenses shown are at the Eastspring expenses. And also we show there the life expenses less -- loadings less life expenses the small piece. But all that actually totals up to your original numbers on your profits.
 Let's look at Eastspring very quickly. As I said, funds under management, growth in funds under management is key to driving revenue. And this picture shows you the growth in those funds since the global crisis and shows you the split about those funds between what it comes from our Asian life business and the rest.
 So overall our Asia life business contributes about 50% of the funds under management. And as you can see, in the period from the global crisis to the Euro Zone 2011 we saw a growth in overall FUM of 7%, but a growth in the life FUM, our Asia life FUM of 18%. From 2011 onwards we've seen the total FUM grow by 15%, life 14%.
 The point there, back to Mike's point, this regular premium from the life business coming in is growing the FUM. So it gives stability to the funds under management for Eastspring.
 This graph, a little busy, splits the revenue -- it's the bar chart split between -- from Asia life which is about a third of the revenue, and the rest which will be the retail funds and the revenue from our UK business, the funds that we run and US funds that we run. And the line are our costs.
 Again we split it into two periods, we always have the jaws effects. Even when funds -- even when revenue has been growing slowly we've been able to keep expenses lower than -- the growth in expenses lower than the growth in revenue, 4% versus 2% between 2008 and 2011. And 15% versus 13% for the more expansive period.
 I think one of the major points to make here is we do get operating leverage because we get sources of revenue from those two places, retail and captive insurance. A simple way of putting it here, but there is many ways of cutting this, is that red bar has always been bigger than our cost. The revenue from everything outside of our revenue from our Asian business has always been greater than all of our costs.
 Let's now turn to the life businesses. These two charts just show on the left hand side our insurance margin and the right hand side our fee income split by country. And just by looking at that visually you see the diversification. It is greatly diversified which, again, is what we like.
 Of course our four biggest businesses, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, make up the lion's share. As you can see at the end -- in the first half of 2015, 69% on the insurance margin, 64% for the fee income. But the other interesting thing which again we like, the diversification is getting more diversified because the others are growing more quickly as you can see.
 Now let's look at some of the stuff I think that you will like. And let's look at the example of Indonesia first of all.
 Indonesia became our biggest contributor to profits on the insurance side in 2010 overtaking Singapore, and has been in that position since then and actually has contributed about 30% of those insurance profits. Why has that happened?
 I am going to repeat myself again. Regular premiums, layer after layer after layer, with great growth rates, 17%, with a product that we like, IOP, regular premium with protection riders. That is what has driven it.
 That has resulted, as you can see on the right-hand side, of a growth rate for the period from 2010 to 2014 of a CAGR of 29%. And even though the AP has slackened off, we still saw a year-on-year -- half-year on half-year growth of 21%, the half-year 2015.
 So let's look -- dig a little deeper at Indonesia and the left-hand side of this chart shows the IFRS profit profile for that product that we sell in Indonesia. And it is relatively flat, it's been at a three-year period, but it is relatively flat, slowly going down over time.
 Now why is it that it is relatively flat and it doesn't fall off a cliff very quickly? Two opposing forces. People get older, we charge more for the coverage and we get more profit -- absolutely (inaudible) the profit margin stays the same.
 Second piece of that is asset management fees are going up as the funds under management grow. The opposing force is policies fall off the books, they lapse and they surrender. But still a relatively flat profile.
 On the right-hand side is an -- just for illustrative purposes, what does this look like under different growth scenarios going forward. The red line is our in-force business at the end of 2014 and what would that look like in terms of no more new business added on?
 And again, for the sake of repeating myself, as Mike said, once you start adding any premium, any new business premium, you very, very quickly get growth in your IFRS profits. And the two lines are -- black and blue is at a 5% level and the blue one is at a 15% level. So very quickly we get growth, we are adding on new business.
 Let's now turn to Hong Kong. As I say, Hong Kong is a tale of two product lines, PAR business and shareholder backed. And as you can see on this slide, the first thing to note is the great growth we have seen both on APE and on IFRS. APE has grown by 24% the end of 2014 CAGR and IFRS profits 22%.
 You've seen a complete takeoff, as you know, in exponential growth in the first half of last year and even through to the third quarter in APE.
 The other thing to note on this chart, as you can see, it is split between PAR and shareholder backed. Over that period more than 70% of our APE comes from PAR. You look at the right-hand side and I would say today -- and remember it is today more than 80% of the profits come from the shareholder backed. So let's dig a little deeper at each of those product lines.
 Starting with shareholder backed, our main product, which makes up the majority of the product in the shareholder backed, is a product called PRUmyhealth. It is a whole of life product, it is a critical [list] product with about 69 diseases that it covers, but it also has a major savings element as well covering both savings and protection needs of the client.
 Again, the left-hand side is the profile of that -- profit profile of that product, very strong fall in profits over time, 8% of APE starting off falling over time to about 5% into year 30. But strong profits falling.
 Why is it falling? We get most of our profits from the protection piece. That business is actually very sticky, but the way we -- as the protection piece grows it is a fixed benefit, the actual amount at risk gets lower and lower so the charge for coverage is lower. So it falls off.
 Again, the right-hand side, it is a very similar picture to the Indonesia picture. Again the red line is what is the profit from the current portfolio going forward. And once you add on new business you are going to get a growth in IFRS profits.
 Now we turn to PAR, and I have talked about PAR before. It is a low slow burn but it is a long, long term burn. We get our profits from transfers from shareholders funds and that is -- 1/9 of that is of the bonus that is declared to the policyholder.
 Now how do we declare bonuses to policyholder? One-third on average is annual bonus, two-thirds is terminal bonus. So the people have to leave, they've got to mature or die or surrender before we actually get that terminal profit, that is why it's way down the line, but it is growing over time.
 Very sticky whole of life business but it grows over time. But when we get it this is going to go on for decades and decades and decades. Once you get it it keeps coming and coming and coming and coming. And by the way, if people surrender more frequently you get even more of it. So you win either way.
 The great beauty of the Hong Kong business is if you combine those two product lines you win in the short term and you win in the long-term.
 So quickly summarizing, I've got three sides I want to go through very quickly. I talked about a profit profile for Hong Kong and Indonesia. This just roughly gives you the same at the PCA level for different growth rates. Again, referring back to once you start adding on new business you get growth in your profits and it shows you the different ranges.
 Next one was mentioned earlier by Mike, our targets, our objectives for 2017 is doubling IFRS profits to over the five-year period, which means we need a CAGR of 15%, we have been growing at 18% to the end of 2014 needing another 13% CAGR from then on.
 We had arranged for FSG which basically converts into a CAGR of 13% to 18%. We have been growing at the 18% range. So we have been growing at the higher end of that range. So, well on track.
 And in conclusion, we have a scale business. We like the profits we are earning and where we are earning them from, particularly insurance margin and fee income. On the insurance side we [are] diversified our profits across country and that -- with the others growing more rapidly that diversification is growing.
 Eastspring is making a bigger contribution as we go forward to the overall IFRS profits of our business. Again, adding to that diversification and the fact that the revenue for Eastspring comes from insurance, the captive insurance and retail again adds to that resilience.
 You put all of that together -- all of that together and you have got a fantastic platform to continue stable and growing profits.
 Thank you very much. With that I am now going to hand over to Lilian and Azim to talk about the insurance business, the real stuff. Thank you.

 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Adrian. Good morning. We are the PCA insurance team. And thank you for giving us the opportunity to showcase the PCA insurance story.
 Now as we presented in the last Investor Day in Singapore, the story so far is our consistent, resilient delivery and market outperformance. And this was all possible because of our advantage platform and, more important, our execution.
 Now we have said many times our strengths lie in the scale and diversity of our business portfolio. We operate 13 businesses in 12 markets serving 14 million customer by over 0.5 million agents and 10,000 active bank branches. Our oldest business is 91 years old and our youngest is two years old. And all this portfolio is wrapped around a governance framework to ensure we make disciplined choices.
 Now notwithstanding the track record and solid platform, we innovate and adapt. We are applying continuous learning and technology to respond with speed and stability. This is to ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments.
 Now this is a very busy slide, but it's actually a true reflection of our businesses -- busy, working to deliver. We call this PCA's insurance TV. And I think we shared with you last year, many and diverse events have happened since then, whether it is political, economical and natural disasters. And more recently of course the decline of the stock market in China.
 Now because of our execution focus and resilience we continue to grow and outperform with 24 consecutive quarter-on-quarter growth. Now this result is unrivaled, not just in the insurance industry, but also across the industry. Over the same 24-quarter period, none of the Dow Jones listed companies had the same run-off uninterrupted growth in terms of revenue.
 Now our market performance spans across multiple dimensions from top line to profitability. We are the largest Pan Asia insurer and we report over 1 billion APE in each of the first three quarters of 2015, a scale no other regional competitors has achieved.
 Now since 2012 our rate of growth in sales accelerated faster than our peers by over 5 points and in profit delivery by 14 points. So how did we do that?
 In agency our objective is to build quality and disciplined agency force. And to optimize performance in niche market we do differentiate the model and the results speak for itself. We outperform both manpower and productivity and we are the number one agency in eight markets.
 Now bancassurance is in our DNA and we have an unparalleled success in driving value for both single part market and multi national bank partners. This platform has enabled us to outperform the market by 1.8 times.
 Now one of our key strengths is the comprehensive product solutions for all seasons. And that also delivers value within our risk boundaries. And when we talk about product solution, it is beyond the technical product. It includes sales support, packaging, training, communication, after sales care and servicing.
 The better we understand our customer the better job we do to fix solutions and services. We have 14 million customers I mentioned, but we are adding 2 million new customers a year, servicing 12 million policies. Now that is big data.
 We convert this to understanding to Guy our customer strategies. Nowadays technology cuts across the value chain of our business. Our back end processing are in two world class data centers, interconnected by a resilient regional network. And we continue to deepen cyber defenses to protect, prevent leakages and attacks.
 Now to answer my earlier questions, how do we do this. The trick is in the doing, execution carried out by our people. We are proud of the 15,000 committed and dedicated people of 40 different nationalities making PCA insurance one of the best performing and respected insurance groups in Asia.
 And this platform is supported by our brand. Brand is important in Asia. We have been investing for almost 100 years and our iconic [prudence] recognition is valued as English is not the first language in most of our markets.
 And in our industry reputations take on a special meaning because the products are not tangible -- are intangible. Now credibility's, from the strength of the brand and for us this is promoted by our brand ambassadors of over 0.5 million feet on the street and 15,000 staff on a daily basis.
 Now brand also creates a barrier to entry as building a brand as prominent as ours takes years of investment. Brand, as you heard earlier, is one of our most valuable assets and a competitive advantage.
 Now as we strive for sustainable growth it is critical to look at the platform looking at ourselves but also looking outside in. Now there are many trends shaping the insurance industry. Foremost recognized that the volatile economic environment is now a new normal as many questions have been asked.
 The investment of technology is reshaping the world and by 2020 the digital universe will equate to 44 [zettabytes]. So the level of data with potential to generate insight will grow to 37%.
 Now data driven decision making is not new to insurance. Data scientists used to be called actuaries. But with the best technology techniques and capacity, analytics now extend across the value chain and in particular customer behavior and expectation. And by 2020 there will be 5 billion people connected to the Internet.
 This changes how our customers demand to interact in the speed of response. And this change is further complicated by a wealthier and more urbanized customer universe.
 Now as customers demand more transparency the governments are also keeping up, evolving regulation focusing on customer protection into major report conduct and capital adequacy.
 Now in the markets we operate in there were 180 new and revised regulations over the last 12 months. That is four every week. So securing the right talent is critical for delivery and as the world evolves the attributes for talent also evolve.
 Now despite all this shift that we are seeing, our strategic pillars remain the same -- growing distribution and reaching customer experience, protecting and managing the enforce book. But to strengthen our execution capabilities we are exploring and implementing innovation and differentiation. And we do so by [reefing] the core focus area as a way of life.
 Now an essential part is a scalable and efficient operating platform. We created capability sustainment for our business to transform the platform, refreshing processes, implementing technology and improving turnaround.
 Now while we are doing that we continue to build on the culture to shape customer experience and decision management driven by data insight. And for data, this is not just about hardware applications.
 We are developing data scientists to turn data into hypothesis so we can make decision. Again, this is not new to us. We have started customer satisfaction studies as early as 1994 and this journey is still ongoing.
 Now this key component of customer experience is actually customer protection and this aligns with what the focus of the regulator. We have an integrated risk approach to enhance strategic decision-making, enable faster response directly changes and drive capital efficiency.
 Now whether we are building out the risk framework, transforming operation, technology is an enabler of all of our business strategies as we look for smarter and more effective ways of doing. At the same time we are also extending the depth of our business portfolio.
 Now building on our strategic pillars we stress test the strategy of each of our businesses looking at ambitions, taking into account the platform, market condition and regulatory environment. This is to make sure each of our [businesses are] delivering and delivering across all metrics.
 Now Adrian earlier mentioned the significant contribution of our four material businesses. Now these businesses are not just material to PCA, they are also leaders in their respective market.
 Now to sustain earnings we are reinforcing the operating platform, managing the profit drivers and ensuring steady growth in new business. For further diversity we are creating more material businesses by scaling up the high-performing ones as growth engines.
 We are investing in distribution, strengthening operations and leveraging regional capabilities. Our ambition is to take each one of those to at least GBP100 million in the near future as we accelerate our ability to execute.
 Now for the two large markets, given the [last] country, our businesses have embarked on a geographic focused strategy with a multi-distribution platform. And for the two in North Asia we are playing in a niche segment and focused to stay lean and fit to drive values.
 Now to demonstrate what we have said so far are being translated to actions, I would like to give you insight at the business level starting with Indonesia.
 Now Indonesia is described as Asia's next big opportunity. Reason? It has a large population, 0.25 billion people and they are very young, nearly 40% not yet 19. It is the widest [archipelagic state] with over 17,000 islands. But the speed and growth differs by region, mainly concentrated in the islands of Java and Sumatra. And the number of emerging middle-class is at 74 million.
 Now however, this middle-class is emerging and they are still fragile. The average emerging consumer is living on less than $4.50 a day. So with the current economic slowdown volatilities this has impacted spending power and with consumer confidence index dipping below 100 for the first time in 2015. Although we are seeing some signs of stabilization.
 Now as the insurance is more retail-based current consumer sentiment has affected growth. But long-term demand is still intact and this is further encouraged by a supportive regulator. (Inaudible) is promoting financial literacy, financial inclusion and customer protection with a vision to build 0.5 million agents to increase penetration. So we have got half of that already.
 Prudential Indonesia has captured a growing share of the insurance market better and faster. Now with our general agency network over 400 we have extended -- extensive footprint in Java and Sumatra and over 50% outside of Jakarta.
 Our infrastructure has the capacity and the scalability for large intake. And the ability to drive expansion makes us a clear market leader being more than two times our nearest [peer] in terms of new business and 1.5 times in terms of total assets.
 So with all the shifting trends have we done a good enough job to optimize the opportunities going forward? Now our penetration of the population has grown 37% over the last 10 years, but it is still less than 1%. Now this contrasts to over 10% in the established markets. So how do we capture these opportunities?
 We are also observing different customer and distribution behavior by region. So how well do we know our customers to better provide the relevant services and solutions by segments? With the fragmented geographic nature of the country is our operating platform scalable and efficient to take on the growth?
 Now while the regulator has ambition to increase penetration they are also introducing more stringent requirements. This adds to our operating costs. Could we turn them into competitive advantages?
 Now in Prudential Indonesia we see these so-called obstacles as opportunities in the business is reshaping the model to reinforce our leadership position. So we are moving from a one size fits all to differentiation, driving both breadth and depth with the underlying strategy being driven by insight and technology. And this evolution will span from agency management to customer management and to in-force management.
 So Indonesia remains one of the most promising insurance markets in the world and Prudential Indonesia has the proven track record and the platform to endure that profit growth story.
 So let's move to an island, Singapore. Now Singapore is Asia's top financial hub and a very competitive financial center. It is an established market, but there are headroom for growth driven by domestic demand.
 The saving cultures in Singapore is very strong. Household assets amounted to over $650 billion. But 40% of that is in cash and deposit and deposit rates are only around 1.5% or less. So there is inherent demand for diversified wealth accumulation solutions.
 Now other than being wealthy Singaporeans look to be healthy as well. There is a strong advantage to protect themselves and their families. The cost of healthcare has increased by double-digit over the years and the growth of hospital admission is three times faster than the growth of the resident population.
 Now with this macro backdrop, the insurance market is still predominantly savings oriented. The top-line growth has been slow in recent years and [bancassurers] are using single [and short pay] savings to prop up market shares.
 So recognizing this capital constraint, we are seeing a shift to regular premium space. And I think as you have heard many times, Prudential Singapore is the consistent market leader in the regular premium segment. We have over 20% market share and 1.5 time leads over the number two.
 And this leadership position is built from our multi-distribution strategy with our strength in agency being both scale and quality and our strength in partnership being the delivery of value for both PRU and now bank partner.
 Now Singaporeans are conscious of the need to manage finances and are keen for face-to-face advice. So in a recent survey only 11% of Singaporeans feel very knowledgeable about financial matter. So what are the barriers of obtaining advice that they prefer?
 We talk about the protection gap earlier, but this is not new in Singapore. But progress has been slow. So average coverage is less than [SGD]150,000 compared to the gap of about SGD350,000. The obstacle is actually cultural with most Singaporeans believing that they could insure themselves with savings rather than transferring the risk. So are there ways that we can help them to close the gap, at least step-by-step?
 Now at Prudential Singapore value over volume is the key to value creation. We achieved 16% growth in new business profits despite being challenged on the top line. And we have used technology effectively to grow distribution, provide innovation solutions and build a [risk-averse] culture.
 Now for the distribution leadership we are equipping our professional agency with knowledge and toolkits to provide the trusted advice that is demanded by our customer. And we continue to drive increased penetration in bancassurance with our partners.
 To remain relevant to our customer we will refine solution and services to close the protection and health gaps and enhance service standard and platform as our competitive differentiator.
 Now there are clearly growth opportunities despite challenges in Singapore. Prudential is leveraging on its core strength to turn problems into profits in our chosen segments.
 Now given the underlying demographics, penetration rates and economic prospect the opportunities and demand for insurance of Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines are actually undisputed. PRU has the track record and is well positioned to capture these opportunities and continue a leadership position in this market.
 Now in Thailand we are the preeminent multi-partner bancassurer working with a national bank, a regional bank and a multinational bank.
 In Vietnam we are the leader since 2007. Our leadership position is made possible because of agency expansion through recruitment and activation. But we are expanding through partnership distribution and has just signed our second strategic agreement with Vietnam International Bank.
 In Philippines we are one of the leading insurer with the largest and most productive agency force. We are leveraging on our regional know-how and is driving geographic expansion with general agencies.
 Now building on our strategic pillars these businesses are also strengthening customer culture and transforming their platforms to provide enhanced services. In Vietnam the transformation has so far reduced turnaround time by 20% and improved issuance to over 90%.
 Let's turn to a giant, China. I know there have been lots of discussion about the recent turmoil in China. But from an insurance angle opportunities and demand for insurance remains strong.
 We could (inaudible) the huge population, low insurance penetration and the mortality gap of $32 trillion, that is 60% of the Asian mortality gap. And this demand is supported by a huge and increasing household income estimated to be over [$]5 trillion a year.
 This all evolves to strong need for financial security and the [insurer] is to play a key role in this growth story. Now the life insurance market is highly concentrated, top five occupying more than 50% the market, foreign JVs still small with pockets of selected growth.
 The State Council has published the Guo Shi Tiao in July in 2015 to promote insurance. And the eminent introduction of C-ROSS, which is the equivalent to a Solvency II, means Company with superior risk and capital management strategy will enjoy better capital efficiency.
 Now while the larger insurers still are the market drivers, there have been a lot of noise on the online space. Life insurance premium from the online grew to 3.5%. But mainly through third-party platform with high distribution costs. And almost 90% are short and single pay savings competing on yields of about 4.5% to 7%. Now because of this high risk of (inaudible) actually CIRC has suspended sales several times since 2014.
 So what we doing in China? This is a big country. So our strategy is for geographic expansion in the right place to optimize results. We are present in 64 cities, in 12 provinces, three municipalities and one autonomous region. This represents 350 million people, that is bigger than the population of the US. It is a third of the population of China and 50% of the GDP.
 So we will only continue to expand into provinces and region that can be financially relevant to us. So with the right footprint we are unlocking the potential with a three-pronged approach: expanding quality distribution; reengineering processes to improve efficient quality; and building a holistic enterprise risk management framework and [build] this into all facets of the business function.
 Actually, we have been praised by the CIRC for the framework that we have demonstrated to them.
 So I hope all the business insight has provided you with a sense of our execution strength. Now the core focus area that I spoke of are not new and are embedded into our businesses to innovate and adapt. And Azim will now take you through that journey and the exciting things that are happening as well as the impact and outcome.

 Azim Mithani,  Prudential plc - COO, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Lilian. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. So as we have seen, the sustained and multiyear success of PCA is driven by our strategic clarity and flawless disciplined execution.
 Within each country we operate our distribution approach builds scale sustainably with both breadth and depth, consolidated and grown existing channels but also added and building out new channels according to local market context.
 For our customers, enriching their experience through tailored solutions and seamless service delivery. All of this executed profitably and sustainably by our committed dedicated people.
 So what lies behind this delivery? What do we need to do to continue to capitalize on the exciting opportunity ahead of us and fulfill the ambition that we have?
 To give you some insight I will be providing an overview of our current focus areas as Lilian has just said. So these focus areas are the following: optimizing our business operating platform; driving superior customer experience; enhancing business outcome through intelligent use of data; leveraging technology to create advantage and capacity; and finally a risk-based approach for superior decision-making.
 So to start with, the first component of our operating platform is our unrivaled multi-distribution franchise and the manner in which we drive it for performance. We manage our distribution according to four all-weather key fundamentals. Firstly, distributor structure; secondly, compensation structure; thirdly, performance management structure; and lastly, the support structure.
 These are then complemented by our executional capabilities for building and managing scale. Each step of the entire lifecycle that a distributor will have with us is actively managed through a seamless process. We have clear proven methodologies covering recruitment on boarded, sales training sales and productivity management, compensation models and standards enforcement.
 Moreover, these models and methodologies are applied consistently for consistent results across our channels, across our businesses and across economic cycles. All of this is underpinned by having clear targets and metrics covering manpower productivity, activity equality as well as channel management capabilities and performance and quality standards often higher and tougher than the [regulatory floor] in the markets in which we operate.
 So today we have a second to none multi-distribution franchise which is both durable and resilient. More than 500,000 agents and 10,000 bank branches promoting our products and services across Asia.
 In addition to these facts we have the largest Pan Asia distribution with the largest agency force in eight of our markets. We run over 13,000 recruitment seminars a year across Asia with over 1.3 million participants at these events. All of this means that we are where we should be, close to our customers, fulfilling and meeting the need and preference for face-to-face advice.
 It is our acute intuitive understanding and a recognition of this of the importance to our customers of personal relationships built on trust that sets us apart. And indeed I know from personal experience that many of our dedicated agents make themselves available to their customers 24x7 in a clear sign of commitment for the interconnected, always-on world in which we live today.
 But at the same time, we continue to enhance and deepen our customers' experience by rescaling and retooling our distributors. Providing advice and point-of-sale solutions as well as plan and information tools.
 For example, we invested nearly 60,000 man hours of training every month also we use technology and data analytics in ensuring this success. Across our markets we are rapidly digitizing the advice and sales process for greater efficiency and accuracy all of which are yielding improvements in operational and financial outcome.
 We also use technology to drive channel management, performance and quality. For example, to reduce [on boarding time] for new recruits by 37% in Indonesia or delivering training programs through online tutorials and examinations across Asia. And we currently have 180 online training programs.
 Now data analytics is also used extensively in many ways, for example, in developing and driving distributor segmentation strategies or using psychographic profiling data to identify likely successful agents and hence tailor recruitment strategies accordingly.
 Ensuring our advisors are fit and proper for the role they perform and that we provide their outcome for the customer are, we believe, competitive advantages. Accordingly, we invest considerable resources to develop region wide standards and are very disciplined in application of those standards. For example, our Pan Asia suitability framework aimed at protecting our customers through proportionate, appropriate needs-based selling principles.
 So all of this means that we are well placed when it comes to changes in the regulatory landscape such as the FAIR regime in Singapore. So this is the first part of our operating platform, the executional ability and capacity to grow and manage a large scale multi-distribution business.
 I touched previously on technology and digitization. As Lilian has already mentioned, we are 100% clear on the need for this, but importantly, for us the advantages and opportunities that digital creates are leveraged -- are best leveraged by integrating it firmly into our overall business strategy where it provides or accelerates the right solution.
 It is always the business strategy that [leads] as it must. And our approach to digital covers the entire spectrum of our activities from customer facing application, applications prospect and needs and advice point-of-sale systems and fulfillment to core administration and distribution management systems and processes.
 The opportunities presented are indeed enormous hence the real edge is the way in which we harness and apply the best of them through a clear outcome oriented process guided always by the overarching business strategy and the customer need.
 But let me reiterate -- this is not about taking a paper-based process and simply casting it into the digitized arena. It is about redesigning and reengineering the advice and sale process, rethinking what it should be. What the customer experience should be in order to make it more enriching, seamless and faster for both customer and distributor.
 So let me give you some small examples. We are today using electronic signatures direct onto a tablet. We use pocket-sized credit card readers in Malaysia and Hong Kong for use with our point-of-sale systems. We eliminate separate proposal forms altogether by making use of partners' electronic data. And of course for PCA it gives us even greater consistency in the sales process and naturally heaps of data to use very, very wisely.
 In case, though, you think that this is something new that we are just embarking on, let me correct now. In actual fact we launched our first electronic submission system way back in 2003. Today we now have 11 businesses using tablet or electronic-based submission apps.
 And in 2014 approximately 1 million proposals were submitted digitally across Asia. So it really is not too hard to imagine a day when our submission processes are fully electronic and indeed paperless.
 Now in regard to our core administration systems, our system architecture is increasingly designed to complement the digitization of the front end. For example, online and automated underwriting or lead management. So this will mean our platform is responsive to the changes the digital era brings.
 And we continue to expand the range of applications, both service related and information oriented. For example, distributor portals provide complete client and CRM information and others that allow them to take advantage of social media trends that we have already talked about.
 But as I mentioned earlier, this is not sufficient in itself. It must have business outcome and this is what we see. An ever increasing proportion of our business can now be (inaudible) without human involvement, more than 60% as at Q3 2015. And of course it contributes to the wider productivity improvements of our agency force, our bank partners and not to mention our operations teams so that we are able to do more with less.
 So these results speak for themselves, all driven by clear line of priorities, a culture of innovation and the desire to lead and a passion to succeed.
 What about customer experience? Customer experience, genuine customer experience is made up of many aspects; it is not just about the right product, as Lilian has said. Equally important is the manner in which it is offered and fulfilled, the accuracy of the day-to-day service interactions, the simplicity and ease of doing business to maybe even just providing a listening ear.
 So the better we understand the better we will be at meeting these expectations. We therefore adopt a holistic multifaceted approach to listening to our customers' needs and identifying the segments that have the greatest commercial potential.
 Our customer offer strategy typically has four steps to it. Firstly, we segment our customers based on life stage, attitudes, affluence and environment. Secondly, we identify segment specific insurance needs. Thirdly, we prioritize those needs by segment potential. And lastly, we develop tailored needs driven customer propositions based on the above steps.
 Once our customer offer strategy has helped us identify commercially attractive segments and identify the relevant consumer needs we have systematic processes in place to develop propositions and test them in the market.
 For example, focused customer research and digital consumer panels to allow our PCA companies to seek feedback from our existing customers and we were the first life company in Asia to do this. We have significant established quality assurance programs with mystery shopping and welcome calls to monitor sales processes and to sales quality.
 So this approach has resulted in many first to market offerings and I can just give a couple examples here. Firstly, PRUmyhealth, crisis multi-cat in Hong Kong, an all-in-one early and multistage standalone CI product. And secondly, an education product that pays out monthly income in Indonesia.
 Now as you would expect of us, all of this development takes place with a clear focus on profitability. Using our deep-seated knowledge of the underlying profit drives and application of the actuarial control cycle.
 Our products must meet clear financial targets including NBP, capital [restraint] and payback. And our risk framework ensures that we have a full understanding of the risks that we are willing to accept and equally those that we are not. So with active management of our product and sales mix the result is annual growth post-tax NBP over 2009 to 2014 of 17%.
 Now integrated value added services for both customers distributor like further differentiates and enhances marketability. And again with limited time I can but just give a couple of examples.
 In Hong Kong we developed a health campaign to raise awareness through PRUmyhealth zone, a first of its kind online health assessment test and coaching platform providing health articles in the knowledge base.
 Secondly our policyholders in Singapore are provided with access to an investment platform which gives information on structure and investment portfolios when they buy from our PRUselect Vantage Premier series.
 Now we need to manage this customer information very well. The salesperson servicing at the point of sale plays an important role in determining customers' overall satisfaction. But there are many other contact points between the customer and the Company where that same high quality standards need to be achieved for this value to be realized.
 We therefore measure and control our performance for each of these and seek feedback on our customer's entire journey with Prudential starting with the initial contact when we acquire them through to claims or maturity.
 For example, we undertake large-scale quantitative research conducted by independent third parties to monitor customer feedback on our services. And we run annual customer distributor satisfaction surveys in nine markets and with over 10,000 interviews.
 Customer experience and management is an area where technology is being used extensively as well to improve outcome. The range of application again is incredibly wide, so just to give some examples: to drive proposition and efficiency by reducing cash collection in an increasing number of markets customers can now pay premiums and service their policies through online platforms.
 And in India 67% of our transactions are now through self servicing mode, 50% of renewal premiums are collected online and 92% of payouts are through electronic mode.
 And in Vietnam and the Philippines we are actively piloting ways in which customers can directly remit money to us directly from their smartphones. We're also using it to deliver services close to the customer and provide information more easily.
 For example, apps that give information about our hospital networks, their facilities and the cost of them all. Now all of this allows our customers to make more informed decisions and ultimately improve loyalty and enhance VIF.
 With regard to analytics, with PCA our focus is very much on the prescriptive component of the well known descriptive predictive prescriptive data analytics framework.
 We are deploying a regional analytic framework that combines traditional data warehouse approaches with big data technologies -- sorry for all the buzzwords -- so we can integrate predictive models and machine loaded algorithms into operational systems to help steer outcome or to make business processes improve experience.
 Again, a couple of examples for you. In our Taiwan business we used employee profile, performance and psychographic testing data to build hiring models that could identify prospective salespeople that are likely to generate above average sales performance and below average attrition.
 As another example by properly understanding when a client's research is at our websites we have been able to make appropriate product and solution offers when an appointment is made with one of our advisors.
 Customer journey mapping and ethnographic research are increasingly important and where we see we can drive and further improve experience.
 So to summarize this, our approach starts and ends with listening and understanding our customer, responding to what they tell us is important to them and what they need from us and then deliver on those promises. So as customers' needs and preferences evolve and become more sophisticated we evolve our approach in a manner that continues to generate sustainable profitable results.
 So as I have just explained, our customers are one of our important assets. Providing them with the right service is not just the right thing to do, it provides competitive advantage so that today we are able to drive more sales and more holdings from our existing customers than ever before to maximize their lifetime value.
 And as of Q3 2015, 38% of our sales come from repeat purchases, demonstrating very clearly the strength of our franchise and the trust our customers have in us. The benefits this has in terms of persistency and realizing VIF into profits and cash go without saying.
 As regards our in-force book more generally, agents already shared the size of it with a VIF of GBP9.6 billion as of 2014. To realize the value of this book means manage it with a holistic approach.
 Customer experience is one component but equally important are the operational rules and framework alongside the financial capital risk boundaries within which we operate and making sure that these rigorously support each other.
 Ultimately we must over the long-term manage the book systematically within the levels we set for each of the actuarial assumptions. This operational framework encompasses, for example, claims adjudication, active bonus and crediting rate policies in management to preserve and optimize capital and strategic asset allocations and investment strategies.
 I will illustrate some of these principles by looking at our approach for medical business and specifically claims management. We write such business within a framework reflective of the nature of the risk.
 So in addition to product design and pricing and sales training standards our integrated claims management framework typically comprises several components: a preferred hospital network and associated network management capabilities. Hospitals are only selected on the basis of rigorous selection criteria.
 Dedicated and experienced claims assessors using clear assessment rules and standards, for example WHO's ICD-10, specialized medical doctors and nurses with practicing experience, analytics, fraud and abuse detection units to monitor and pursue any errant behavior be it by hospitals, doctors, agents or customers.
 More recently is the result in the roll out of PRUhospital friend at panel hospitals in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, not just for customer expense but of course for hospital engagement and fraud prevention. So once more this illustrates how an integrated approach can help to manage both VIF and so far realize profits.
 Now moving along. Being fit for growth also means having an equally robust operational and service model for both new and in-force that complements and reinforces the distribution and customer facing platforms that I have already talked about. Operational efficiency is about cost optimization, cost flexibility and productivity and accuracy.
 Now we achieve these objectives by target operating models and for each of our businesses including technology roadmaps. And we have on our big US productivity and performance metrics and targets, capacity planning and measuring and driving quality of outcome complete how we run this aspect of our operational platform.
 Equally here automation of processes and decisions is an integral part of how we are building efficiency and advantage within this framework. Data analytics is another, often they work hand-in-hand. Let me illustrate these by showcasing a couple of examples once more.
 In Hong Kong redeveloped and ran an analytic model for our medical indemnity business to help identify any potential waste or abuse. Using defined criteria such as length of stay in hospital, each claim is assessed against the portfolio outcome.
 The analytics not only validated the robustness of the existing claims adjudication process, but it also provides the building blocks for use of analytics driven claims scoring rules for real-time claim decisioning.
 Second area, optical character recognition, or OCR, is a rapidly evolving technology, but one that we already -- already harness it. In our Indian business we built an in-house OCR tool to read and digitize submitted paper identity documents.
 In Hong Kong, in the previous example, as part of the analytical model we have tested and proven OCR technology for use with [these] hospital bills as part of the move to automated decision-making.
 Once more all of this is covered by an integrated risk framework designed to ensure appropriate risk selection and management, availability, integrity and security of our data, covering both usage and penetration threats.
 So that gives you an overview of how we are focusing in a number of key areas to drive our operating form. But I would just like to wrap up here by just giving some figures for you.
 The results of this work mean that in 2014 we issued 3.5 million policies. And during the time it has taken to deliver this presentation we have issued another 380 policies and serviced 710 customers. And in the last hour, as Tony has already told us, we have recruited 200 agents.
 So that it really is an operating platform that consistently delivers unrivaled performance and attractive returns for our shareholders. With that let me thank you for your time and pass back to Lilian. Thank you. Lilian.

 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [5]

 Thank you. Thanks, Azim. Now all the execution that actually comes down to people. And our strategic focus on talent management and succession planning have actually make a difference as you can see from the statistics.
 But as the world keep changing we are looking at talent differently so we are formulating strategic plan to ensure capacity to deliver growth. And we are also, like another facet of the business, using technology and data analytics to understand our people and to make people decision to ensure we have a fit for growth talent pool.
 I think Mike mentioned this, we have top three position in nine out of our 12 markets. But market share is never our objective, it is an outcome. Our objective is to build quality business for sustainable and profitable growth. And market leadership is a result of our execution.
 Now I hope Azim and I have demonstrated to you our resilient platform and our execution strength. I apologize for a lot of repetitive messages that we have given you, but it is a reflection of our consistent delivery. Thank you.
 So with that I think just to emphasize on the theme of delivery, our Hong Kong management team will give you a deep dive of the Hong Kong business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Derek Yung,  Prudential plc - CEO, Prudential Hong Kong   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am Derek Yung, CEO from Hong Kong and with me I have my CFO, Mr. Ben Bulmer, sitting on my right hand side. And sitting on my left hand side is our Chief Marketing Officer, Mr. Anthony Shaw.
 We would like to spend the next 20 minutes providing you with an overview of the dynamics of the Hong Kong market and the positioning and the performance of the Hong Kong Prudential Company.
 As more of you will be aware, the Hong Kong market is a sizable one with about 60 billion of APE written in 2014. And new business volumes that have grow 14% compound between 2010 and 2014. And 2015 is no exception. We reported industry volumes up 21% year on year as of Q3 2015 according to the data issued by the Hong Kong regulator.
 In fact, the growth outlook for the market as a whole is very strong and there are solid structural reasons underpinning that. Domestic demand centers around retirement savings and health and in protection.
 Retirement savings needs are driven by a de minimis Social Security net, very limited employer contribution schemes and increasing longevity and rising dependency ratios. As a result your average Hong Kong has no option but to voluntarily purchase savings and insurance products.
 In addition, an awareness of the need for health and protection products is generally high. An aging population, relatively low benefit growth scheme offered by employers, the government's desire to manage (inaudible) medical expenditure from the public purse and the rising cost of medical attention shape the market for these sorts of products.
 What's more, in recent years, growth in the Hong Kong market has been filled by mainland visitors increasingly seeing the benefits of purchasing life insurance in Hong Kong. The number of mainland visitors to Hong Kong has grown 20% CAGR since 2010 and is now at 15 million a year, a clear demonstration of the increasingly porous nature of the border between Hong Kong and mainland.
 A portion of these visitors, they buy insurance products among other things and frequently travel to and from the territory furthering business and commercial interests. Mainland visitors buy life insurance products in Hong Kong for a number of reasons.
 Firstly, diversification in terms of both currency and asset class. Secondly, brand [interests] are very important factors. Global insurers have a reputation of honoring claims and terms and conditions. (Inaudible) is the confidence in Hong Kong's UK-based [legal] system. Thirdly, degree of surface orientation, assets to the professional financial planners with broad product spectrums.
 A sense of Hong Kong ensures being easy to do business with. We believe that mainlander provides a significant long-term opportunity for the Hong Kong insurance industry, an opportunity Prudential Hong Kong has been pursuing with intent for the last 10 years.
 If you look at Guangdong alone there is a proxy for the wealthiest of the seaport. Then the fundamentals of the middle-class emerging story are very compelling. Increasing urbanization, an aging population and wealth creation contribute to an [estimate] doubling of our target customer base in that province alone over a 10-year period. It is a province that while populous has less than 1/10 of the entire China population.
 Prudential Hong Kong recently celebrated its 50-year anniversary. We are a market-leading Company with [significant] scale delivering profitable sustainable growth. At quarter three 2015 our market share was approximately 18%. We have a value over volume ethos. We pursue shareholder value through addressing customers' needs and allocating capital in a disciplined manner.
 We maintain a broad product portfolio with particular focus on regular premium accumulation and protection products. Our goal is to be the Company of choice for our policyholders, staff and distributors.
 We have a resilient established multi-product multi-channel platform, a fantastic plan and a lengthy track record in Hong Kong. Our distribution footprint is large and diverse and we innovate to meet customer needs across life cycles.
 Lastly, execution is the key. We invest in developing best-in-class employees and distributors. We focus on creating value for our customers and we actively manage the in-force book of over 1.6 million policies to protect the value created by writing the new business.
 And we bring market leading disciplined governance to the industry. As you will expect from a business scale of Prudential Hong Kong, there is significant infrastructure underpinning our delivery. We have a very mature, sustainable platform and approach.
 Hong Kong distribution is primarily intermediate, so let me briefly describe our [distribution facing] services. Our licensing, on boarding, training and development is undertaken by our own Academy of Financial Services.
 We currently on board on average approximately 500 agents per month and in 2015 provided over 300 separate distribution training programs. We have a first in market integrated sales platform spanning pre-sales, partner sales and post-sales (inaudible) and services.
 In addition, we have an area of digital and physical means of servicing distributors and customers including our own medical centers. Sales management and oversight is provided by specific channel and distribution management teams focused on performance, conduct and compensation.
 Internally, we deliver integrated customer proposition development. Supported by brand and marketing campaigns in highly developed in house risk acceptance and assurance capabilities.
 And we continue to invest heavily in our IT operations and people and we bring, I believe, a very balanced approach to capital management as well. Prudential Hong Kong has been in the business since 1964. Accordingly we have a rich heritage, strong proprietary knowledge and well established and comprehensive governance.
 Now I would like to turn it over to Ben to talk about our performance and quality of business. Ben?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ben Bulmer,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Hong Kong   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Derek. If you look back over the last five years the volume value profits and cash story of Prudential Hong Kong is one of strong balanced year-on-year growth and the 2015 interim results were no exception.
 In terms of volumes, sales grew 24% compound from 2010 to 2014. The equivalent market growth rate over this period was 14%, a rate of growth which our local business alone has exceeded. In fact, local volumes were up 48% year on year in the first half of 2015.
 In addition to the strong sales performance of both our local and our mainland business we have grown margins through increasing our health and protection penetration.
 And importantly in this economic environment, being very disciplined about repricing product and playing to our strengths of manufacturing total returns propositions. This is in contrast to our competitors who have traditionally competed on a guaranteed returns basis.
 We continue to deliver very strong IFRS growth at a 23% compound growth rate as we build scale in that shareholder bank book from what was a relatively small portfolio about 10 years ago. And growth in that shareholder bank book is very much evident in growth in [free surplus] generation from the in-force book. And in conjunction with improvements of new business strain this continues to build the balance sheet strength of the business.
 But Prudential Hong Kong is not just a growth story, it is one that focuses on quality of growth and resilience. And within that diversification is important bringing both defensive risk-related benefits and a broader spectrum of new business opportunity.
 Now the pie charts shown here are value-based attributions and they demonstrate a number of things. Firstly are leaning towards captive agency field force distribution, something we have grown markedly in recent years. This is a channel that consistently delivers high-quality sales and servicing.
 Secondly, whilst participating business drives headline volumes and supports franchise costs, we place considerable emphasis on how we build on that to drive health and protection sales. As you can see, health and protection is now over half our business in value terms.
 Thirdly, whilst we are very successful but capturing the mainland opportunity we are also very focused on our local book and ensuring that value continues to emerge from that.
 Now one of the outcomes of pursuing these strategies is that we have increased the proportion of our IFRS earnings attributable to insurance margins from 41% in 2010 to 61% in the first half of 2015.
 Lastly, the chart here on the bottom right illustrates the quality of sales made and ongoing efforts to manage the bank book in that the business consistently delivers positive free surplus generation experience year on year. And that is despite better than assumed persistency.
 To date, in fact, both mainland and local claims and persistency is consistently strong. And if anything mainland experience is slightly better.
 That shouldn't be -- really be surprising because if you take a macro look at our policyholders there are some broad similarities. So Prudential Hong Kong has over 780,000 customers of which roughly one-fifth are mainland Chinese.
 Now the vast majority of these customers, irrespective of place of residency, are what we would deem to be mass affluent with case sizes between $4,000 to $5,000 or less, albeit the distribution of mainland customer case sizes is slightly more right skewed.
 We run customer panels regularly to gain greater customer insight into their preferences. And whilst our mainland demographic is slightly younger than our local one with over half of our mainland customers aged between 26 and 45 years of age, both local and mainland customers have broadly similar savings, protection, critical illness and medical needs. And this is borne out in the APE distribution byproduct.
 As you can see from the heat map on the right our own mainland customers are concentrated along the wealthy southern seaboard. And people from Guangdong and Fujian province make up by far the greatest proportion of that.
 These are wealthy, well-educated people visiting Hong Kong on average eight times a year with a demographic socioeconomic profile that is remarkably similar to Hong Kongers. So with that I will hand over to Anthony to introduce our distribution strengths.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Anthony Shaw,  Prudential plc - Chief Officer, Marketing &amp; Customer Service, Prudential Hong Kong   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Ben. So Prudential Hong Kong, the agency force is responsible for around about 65% of companywide APE and has had a five-year compound annual growth rate of around about 27%. If we go to the Q3 industry data, we are number one in terms of headcount with about 23% of all the agents in the marketplace and number one in the agency segment with around about 38% of new business APE.
 So this is a result of a very deliberate strategy to grow both our agency numbers as well as their productivity. We have pursued a number of strategies to do that.
 We recruit Hong Kong based distributors with very strong China networks and there has been a number of sources for that. We pursue one way permit holders is another range we call the emigration arrangement for nonlocal graduates and also dependents of [migrant schemes] have all yielded good results.
 In addition, our agency leaders have also been a big contributor to our success. All of our agency leaders are full-time professional agents with more than 20 years experience. Our training programs have also helped; we've got a range of programs aimed at driving agent efficiency.
 So the result of all of this is we've been able to drive very consistent improvements in our agent productivity over the last few years.
 Again, if we go to the Q3 numbers in the market what we are able to see is the average productivity for a PRU agent is around about HKD528,000. So that is 35% higher than AIA, it is 48% higher than AXA and 107% higher than Manulife.
 We think there is still headroom. I think a lot of that is going to come from our technology and digital platforms. And consistent with that, in November last year we launched our market-leading digital workbench for our agents, our brokers and our SEB FSMs.
 Again, consistent with the productivity story we are talking about, we have the largest number of [MDRT] agents in the market. And as you would expect from a Company of kind of our size and maturity, there is a robust management infrastructure for support and control of the agency force. Again, strong Companywide persistency and the agency persistency numbers underscore the effectiveness of that.
 With regard to partnerships, PRU has been very effective in using these partnerships to drive incremental customer reach as well as giving our customers a choice in terms of how they access the Company's solutions.
 We generally can say we have a unique model, we have both the SCB relationship managers selling in branch as well as our own agents based in branch, there's 150 of them, financial services managers. The provisions in the regulations that permitted that have subsequently changed and our arrangements have been grandfathered.
 We have been working with SCB for over 15 years now, so as you would expect we've got pretty significant infrastructure around sales and operations which is very much customized to facilitate the sale of insurance in branch.
 In addition to the actual physical infrastructure there is a relationship. We work very closely with SCB particularly on joint target setting and prioritization of business development initiatives. Azim kind of alluded to data analytics propensity modeling is absolutely integral to the relationship with the bank, it has helped us achieve a lot.
 For example, in the last few years we have managed to double the amount of H&amp;P APE coming out of that business which is largely attributable to that.
 On the broker side, slightly more recent history, but still some really impressive results. So we have grown our broker share from 2% in 2012 to around about 19% at that moment. And again, this is a result of a very deliberate strategy to selectively activate brokers in the Hong Kong market.
 If you look at the Hong Kong market there are about 650 broker organizations. We have got arrangements or agreements in place with 270 of them. 172 of them are producing at the moment. So we see headroom in that space still for us.
 We are going to continue to strengthen and deepen the relationships we have got with the brokers we like again largely using digital means to extend our service proposition.
 The mix on the broker side fairly heavily skewed toward savings, so we think there is also an opportunity there to shift it more towards H&amp;P.
 Products played a very big role in the success of Prudential Hong Kong, we have a number of market-leading propositions. Just to give you some context before we talk about say three of those. The first thing to keep in mind is Hong Kong has top five longevity for males and females in terms of global longevity.
 It is also a very, very low taxing regime. An individual is going to pay a top marginal rate of around about 15%. If you have a couple with two children they are going to earn about $40,000 and pay zero tax.
 As Derek alluded to, the state pension is very low and almost impossible to get. And then the mandatory retirement savings schemes also have significant caps and limits in them so they are insufficient.
 So if we talk about our most popular product proposition it is Evergreen Growth Saver, and what that is is a whole of life savings proposition. It offers customers attractive projected returns, a simplified application process. And what it really does, it leverages the very significant history that the Company has got in successfully delivering these products in Hong Kong.
 Another very successful proposition which Adrian alluded to is crisis lifelong care. It is a combination savings and protection product. It offers customers a lump sum payment to protect against the financial impact of any one of 69 illnesses.
 The last one, still in other popular proposition, is cancer protector. This is a reimbursement benefit that helps customers cover the costs of cancer treatment. And again, it is aimed at offering customers access to some of the more advanced diagnostics and cancer treatments that might be either excluded from their mass-market reimbursement plan or from their group scheme.
 As Tony alluded to, we track the amount of APE and NBP that is attributable to either newly launched or revamped propositions. And if you look at say the last 24 months, a little over 50% of our new business profit is attributable to those freshly launched propositions. So on that note I will pass you back to Derek who will do the wrap up.

 Okay, thank you, Anthony. In conclusion I think that Prudential Hong Kong is a market-leading Company of choice. We're positioned to continue to deliver ongoing success. We have truly multi-channel distribution with significant reach. Our agency force number around 13,000 agents at the end of 2015 capturing close to 14% of the agency channel sales.
 We have productivity levels our competitors are really envious of. We hold the longest standing most successful bancassurance partnership and we have recently diversified our partnership distribution to include brokers, as Anthony just mentioned. And about 14% of our distribution is now through this channel, up from less than 1% in 2010.
 We have depth and breadth in our product portfolio with integrated propositions and unique [with profit] strength. We cultivate a strong trusted brand through our own conduct from investing in our distribution and employees, releveraging a mature risk focused culture. And working with the regulators to continue to shape the industry.
 Thank you. Now may I pass the meeting to our asset management team? Thanks.

 Guy Strapp,  Prudential plc - CEO, Eastspring Investments   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, good afternoon. And we are the last presentation for the morning and as soon as we are done we have an opportunity for Q&amp;A I think for the PCA business.
 But firstly, I want to share the Eastspring story, which I think is a wonderful one. And if I reflect on when I took over as Chief Exec a little over two and half years ago, I set about a number of pretty simple priorities. One was to articulate a clear strategy that the Firm could understand and the leadership could drive. And to that point making sure that the leadership team was the best in the industry.
 So if I think about our Chief Executives and the team that drives the business across Asia, we have about 18 key individuals. And of those eight are new, either -- new in their role I mean -- they have been either promoted up through the ranks or are new from the industry.
 And in capturing talent from the industry what has been very clear is that Eastspring has become truly an employer of choice. In the sort of [CVs] that we see now as compared with three to five years ago is poles apart.
 So it was important that we had a strategy, it was important that we had people who could execute well on that strategy and then also obviously deliver results.
 And as I stand here now and reflect on those three things, I think the strategy is still relevant; we are going to share that with you over the next 20 minutes. I think there is no doubt that our team is the best team in Asia. And I think that the results speak for themselves in terms of what the team has achieved over the last 2.5 years.
 So I'm going to take you quickly through the numbers because they are a little stale as we know. But it is important just to refresh on those. I will just refresh the strategy and talk about what we are dealing with in terms of priorities.
 And I think perhaps more interestingly, Michele will talk about our key advantages in terms of our diversity of our footprint and the way in which we execute in our geographies across Asia.
 So just looking at the flow numbers as they were in 2014 and 2015 through to September. In 2014 for third-party flow as shown here was a record year. Interestingly enough a lot of equity flow shown in red whereas the previous couple of years have been more around fixed income products. But strong and in fact record flow numbers in 2014.
 And as at September 2015 a 33% lift on the previous corresponding period. So the momentum of 2014 was perpetuated into 2015. So here I show the external flow scaled back down so I can make room for the life flows and the story remains pretty much the same.
 So 2014 a GBP10 billion plus year for Eastspring, the first time we achieved that, pretty much contributed equally by the third-party business as well as by the life businesses both in Asia and in the UK making a reallocation back into Asian markets.
 And then the story for 2015 through to September, again reinforcing the continuation of that process. So a 27% lift year on year on what was a previous record. So strong third-party flow.
 And we know that that helps underpin of course assets under management and we really need that strong positive third-party flow because markets haven't really been giving us much help. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index in pounds sterling for the five years finishing on Friday is just slightly negative.
 So in the last five years, a period in which I think Adrian made reference to the fact that we doubled our funds under management, we have had very little lift out of equity markets in Asia. And so the slide shows here a lift from a year end GBP77 billion to GBP82 billion as at the end of September.
 Of course that doesn't marry up with the flow numbers I just showed you and that is because markets took away about GBP2 billion of FUM and foreign exchange translation took away another GBP3 billion.
 So GBP5 billion of headwind to the year ending September. Beyond our control, nothing we can do about it. What we can do is ensure the robustness of the underlying business, which I think is demonstrated clearly here.
 And then on the right-hand side the profit. And after a number of years where we were hovering around GBP70 million and making kind of a nice contribution for shareholders, but nothing spectacular. And we did have some headwinds with the 2008 crisis and again in 2011 with Europe where the Asian market suffered. And indeed in 2013 the taper tampering so the tapering tantrum saw a selloff in markets.
 But last year we achieved GBP90 million, kind of a bit of a breakout year. Strong profit growth on prior of 32%. And then really pleasingly year on year to the half to June of last year a 35% lift on of course what was a previous record profit number. So really healthy momentum flowing through all of the numbers that we follow.
 Of course you want to know how we position that on the competitive basis. And this is about as close as I can get to finding some meaningful data, this is flow into Asia ex-Japan product. They our global numbers. But it does show the industry over the last year and nine months in out flow.
 And not surprisingly the big downshifts, the first one and the last one attributable mainly to European and US investors taking their money out of emerging markets. And the Eastspring experience has been the converse of that, we have had positive flow against a market that has seen outflows in Asia.
 And that is not surprising, and Michele will talk a bit about that in terms of our local model and the fact that so much of our assets under management is sourced from Asia which is a key advantage for us.
 So many of you will have seen this previously in terms of the nature of our business. On the left the client mix, very well diversified, that has been discussed. The asset mix, also well diversified, we are very much a 50-50 shop, we have been for a long number of years. So we are neither in equity specialist or a fixed income; we play well in both.
 And so that diversified client mix and asset mix has stood as in really good stead in what has of course been volatile and pretty single directional volatile, i.e., downward markets, as we have seen in Asia.
 The other one that really helps us out is the geographic footprint. Really well diversified source of AUM. Michele is going to talk about India, Japan, Korea and also the life business in a moment. So I will leave that for her to explore.
 Of course investment performance is critical; we can have distribution engines and we can have geographic diversification and all of that. But if we don't have consistent, dependable investment performance then it is very difficult for us to be able to position ourselves in the third-party market or for that matter provide adequate returns for our life clients.
 And so we've been pretty happy to be able to maintain this number. It is a little below two-thirds. So this represents the percentage of our funds that are outperforming over a rolling three-year period. It's stuck pretty much around 62%, as I said just below two-thirds which is sort of the target.
 But not bad for a firm and M&amp;G will talk about this this afternoon, for a firm that is more value or valuation driven in the way we approach equities. Most of you in the room will know it has been a pretty ghastly five years for value driven managers.
 And so, our core Asia ex-Japan portfolios have struggled a little. They've been really well offset by things like our fixed income range of funds which are I think number one in Asia, certainly according to the flow of money we have seen and the awards that we have picked up.
 Our Japanese equity product has been second to none and we have won mandates and picked up retail money far and wide. And as was alluded to earlier, the Asia equity income product, which has been a number one selling product in Japan, has weathered the storm mainly because it hasn't been so fixated on value.
 Of course it has chased dividend and a lot of the dividends are extracted from boring utility companies and the like which of course are trading on really high multiples. So that fund is slightly different. But again reflects the diverse nature of the business.
 Another important measure about how we stand up competitively is the profitability of the business, the margins we generate. I think we generate margins at a very healthy level. I think it reflects and underpins that fact that we are making good return for shareholders, but that we are also investing adequately in the business.
 So a cost to income ratio of 60% or an operating margin of 40% stand us in good stead against our global peers. And I think this is a really commendable number for a Firm like Eastspring because our model is a complex one. We have investment teams in 10 countries and that means that we have to support them with all of the regulatory rigor, etc., that we are all familiar with.
 So it is a costly model. But I think we execute it well. And that is certainly reflected in these numbers from Casey Quirk that show that we are competitive in terms of the returns we generate.
 The last one I will talk about is our strategy. We refresh this regularly but we stick to it. The important one I think or the interesting one here without laboring through the entire menu of our strategic opportunities is the first one.
 As was alluded to earlier, we've been doing a bit of work in private equity and mezzanine debt and loans. And two years ago started putting together an infrastructure team to deal in or look for opportunities for the life Company in direct infrastructure opportunities both debt and equity.
 And not only have we successfully put that team together, but in Q3 -- or Q4 we made our first investment into a Philippines opportunity on the island of Mindanao. Our second deal is lined up and ready to go and there is really -- which is in a fund to fund structure.
 And a third opportunity is imminent which I think is perhaps the most exciting of them all, which is a debt investment. But we will see the life companies position themselves as the GP in a fund structure.
 So three different, one direct, one fund to fund and one looks like a GP fund structure are our first three investments in infrastructure. And obviously giving the life Company diversification, giving them longer duration and a whole set of new opportunities.
 And importantly investing back into the markets -- into the markets in which we operate in Asia. But that is a really exciting initiative for us. I hope to be able to talk more about that at future Investor Days.
 The rest of it is laid out, I'm not going to go through that. I would like to leave Michele sometime to talk about the opportunities from a distribution point of view in terms of how we derive success. So, Michele.

 Michele Bang,  Prudential plc - Deputy Chief Executive, Eastspring Investments   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Guy. Last night I was having dinner with some of you and it struck me how worried you were about Eastspring, all the outflows, China volatility.
 And how is it possible for Eastspring to continue to grow in this environment? And the key thing is three things: one, access to clients; second, partnership with life; and third, investment performance.
 So the opportunity for asset management industry. We are only 11% of global AUM starting from very low ground. Mutual fund growth, however, in the last five years has been growing at 15% versus the global industry average of 8%.
 We're still at a very low penetration of mutual fund as percentage of household assets. You heard this all throughout today: Asia 6% versus US 17% and Europe 12%.
 Unlike our life clients, large asset pools for asset management industry reside in North Asia. However, the remaining 25% while Lilian and her team is gathering assets in those markets will translate in the next decade into mutual fund markets. That gives us competitive advantage over our global peers that barriers of entry to those markets where we have advantage. So I will come back to that in a minute when we have strategic partnership with life.
 Growing levels of wealth, 40% of world's wealthiest live in Asia, forecast to grow to 64% in just 14 years. Retirement needs, by 2050 two-thirds of retirees will live in Asia. And today only 35% benefit from government pension scheme.
 So current working population, current retirees must save with future and they do it through investments. So that's our opportunity.
 So what is it that we do with life that provides us our strategic competitive advantage versus our global peers? We have to be in 14 markets. So 10 you heard we have local manufacturing.
 What are the other four? We do have offices in US and UK because our life clients include those two. So that means we have a client profile of the most sophisticated institutional client base as well as a large, diverse retail distributors in all corners of Asia-Pacific. And that is our client.
 So we have to create local products, local fund delivery, investment strategy, you heard from Guy infrastructure debt, low volatility equity in Singapore market. And that all adds up to us incubating strategies, gathering assets, having investment teams and finally commercializing that for our third-party clients.
 So that will come through in the three examples I'll show you in three very different markets. First is Japan. Highly competitive, most of all of our peers are all in Japan.
 Multi-distribution market, you have white labeling with third-party asset managers, mega brokers, trust banks and online. You name it, everyone is they are.
 So how is it that Eastspring has captured this market? Income. The demographic, the retirement demographic as well as persistent low interest rates has asked for income over and over again.
 Our largest, most successful white label partnership has been with the local asset management Company. And we provide our investment strategy for Asia high dividend income fund. It is the best-selling ninth largest actively managed fund in Japan.
 In addition to that, we are also a market leader in Indian funds. So whilst you are hearing about the China volatilities we have been very busy gathering assets into our Indian equity and debt fund. We are a market leader in Indian products.
 When Prime Minister Modi visits India we have a client seminar at the Indian Embassy. That's how we are entrenched into the local market but delivering in local fund vehicles in Japanese yen.
 So I'm sure some of you heard the terminology Asia passport. Does anyone know what that means? No? Okay.
 If you're a global asset manager, what you would like is you want one fund structure, register it everywhere and get the money. That's what Asia passport means. But in practice it's very, very difficult because of the investor behavior.
 Japanese investors do not want an offshore fund. It is regulatorily allowed, it has been available in Australia and Japan, the most developed markets in Asia for decades. No one buys them.
 So the reality is if you are going to Into this market, you have to have a local fund structure but investment strategies best-in-class. So that's what we have been doing.
 Couple with that we've built the best distribution team in retail distribution as well as institutional. We serviced the largest pension fund in the world, GPIF, in our Japanese equity fund. We have a distribution team that covers mega banks, the brokers, we've conducted over 700 branch-to-branch nationwide customer conference.
 Now you can't really do that when you're sitting in Boston or in London because you actually have to go to those branches, 700 times. So imagine that. That's the distribution force we've built in the last two years. So Japan we had net inflow of GBP1.9 billion.
 Korea, another very different market. In terms of demographic it is quite aging society looking for income but all they wanted was domestic products. They could care less about high-yield, global, optimal, multi-asset funds. All they wanted was domestic equity and fixed income for the last 10 years.
 So Eastspring Investments because of servicing our life client built over the years, over the last 10 years, best equity investment team, fixed income team, balanced management so when the regulation change that you must give 50% of your AUM to a non-affiliate, we gained, in fact, money from third-party insurance company all of our local life clients competitors gave us money. So that is what I mean by strategic partnership with the life. We not only have servicing requirements but the investment team must be able to perform top quartile in order to gain third-party clients.
 So when now the Korean market is moving away into investing in foreign products, we're there as well. We have partnerships with our global affiliates, PPMA in the US, Citi Prudential in China and M&amp;G to bring offshore products in a local domicile fund. So those are some innovations that we can react to in the market.
 We are the second largest inflow in the industry into a retirement pension product. So total net inflow from Korea, GBP1.4 billion.
 My last market completely different it's India. India has been an example mentioned by many of the market players about the burgeoning retail market. It's true.
 It grew at 22% since 2012. We own 49% of ICICI-Pru Asset Management. It is truly a market leader.
 In terms of fund performance over 100% of the funds performed over the benchmark three, five, 10 years. 94% of funds performed in top quartile over five years.
 So with that we have captured over 87% of all the distributors in India. And we continue to invest in digital technology and direct sales. As we heard many times today that 15% of sales is coming through digital medium.
 So India, GBP1 billion last year. These are some of the three examples, very different market, different client base that we captured last year. There are many more examples to explain to you but I ran out of time.
 So with that I will pass over to Guy on the wrapping remarks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Guy Strapp,  Prudential plc - CEO, Eastspring Investments   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I can assure you I never tire of that because it's unique. It's refreshing every time to hear it because there is no other competitor who could stand in front of a forum like this and talk about those markets and the depth of experience and knowledge we have. And it's just such a key part of what makes Eastspring what it is today.
 But as others have said we are in a very early phase of development. The Asian markets are young. We are a relatively young firm.
 I think we are delivering some really exciting results. But it's almost a bit of a watch-this-space story because I think over the next five years, the next 10 years, the next 15 years Eastspring is positioned like no other firm in Asia to seize the opportunity both in partnering with our life business but also capturing the third-party opportunity.
 So with that I'll just leave you with a message of incredible positiveness from my side as well is from the senior team because I think we work in an incredible franchise with just unlimited opportunity. So really thank you for your indulgence this afternoon.

Unidentified Participant   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so we are ready for Q&amp;A. So fire away.
================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James Shuck,  UBS - Analyst   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's James Shuck from UBS. I had two questions please. Thank you for the description around technology and how you are using that in the Asian agents. I'm just keen to get a bit more insight into how you see the agencies at the moment and how you see a fully digitalized agency.
 So in terms of lead generation, the customer interaction, the level of admin that's provided at the local level and any insight into how you would view increasing productivity as you digitalize those agencies would be helpful.
 And then secondly on Hong Kong, you mentioned you are adding 500 agents per month. There are 12,500 agents at the moment, so the growth rate is about 40% or so year on year if my math is right.
 Could you just give some insight into the productivity of the different cohorts of agents that are coming on each year? I'm interested to know are those 500 each coming on per month are they as productive as the ones that were on the books say two or three years ago?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, sure. Let me take the first question and may be Lilian can go for the second one on Hong Kong.
 First, the evolution of agency and how technology plays a role, I think you know there's a lot of hype in the marketplace around this with digital garages and so on and so forth. I think Azim mentioned this in the presentation, our digital journey began over a decade ago. And one thing that was very clear to us is you can't build all these fancy front-end, wireless interconnected things if your backend isn't fixed.
 And we actually spent years making sure that the backend was stable, scalable and secure. So we've got that set. And then we started the journey, and as Azim said and Lilian said it actually integrates very closely with how the agents make the sale.
 It's transforming the sales process. And to the degree it makes that more standardized, we get a lot of comfort in that because it actually helps us -- it gives us more comfort around the suitability, the sales process. One area we cannot stumble on is mis-selling, so it gives us a lot of help in that regard.
 Using the data, the technology and the data to drive better performance, again this big data analytics 3.0 stuff, we've been running propensity models, which is little more than gap analysis, we've been running those for five years or more. And I don't have the exact data in front of me, but the Hong Kong team can prove that where they've run these data analytics, identified who the target customer is, what product to sell them and when, we have actually increased productivity. That's something we're rolling out across all countries.
 Obviously, some are more advanced in terms of evolution and adoption of technology and related connectivity, but it is definitely driven greater increase in agency. I don't see technology making agency go away. There is still a huge propensity in Asia for the face-to-face, trusted relationship.
 So it's our job to use the technology to enhance the delivery of the services and products and make the agents more productive. That's the journey and it's measurable and it's successful. I don't know if you want to talk about Hong Kong.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think the question was in terms of whether our new cohorts are more productive in Hong Kong. I think Mike mentioned earlier, we actually differentiate our agency modeled by country.
 In Hong Kong it is a highly professionalized agency for us. They have certain validation criteria and I know Derek and the team actually increase the validation every year.
 So I think if you look at it, I think probably our newer recruits probably have higher productivity as a result. And I think that's also demonstrated by the number of MDRTs that I think Anthony referred to, as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes and that's important to know because that is not just a Hong Kong phenomenon. One of the reasons the franchise has developed so well is we hold our agents accountable clearly to certain standards of quantity and quality which typically exceeds that of the industry. Many times when our agents fail to pass muster with our standards they will actually leave and become agents for the competitors, and that's fine because they are not operating at the level we need them to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Stewart,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks very much, it's Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. Two questions please.
 We hear a lot about the emergence of the middle class in Asia over the next few years, and I just want to talk about some of the risk factors in these two questions. What could stop that or is it simply unstoppable? What do you worry about?
 And secondly, given some of the trends you've seen with weak commodities, weak currency markets do you have any asset quality concerns for what you've got on the balance sheet? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let me take the first one on the middle class and maybe Lilian can help and Adrian can cover after any exposures on the balance sheet related to commodities. I'm sure you know, Blair, there's a lot you can read upon the emerging middle class. OECD a whole bunch of different think tanks have come out with metrics and they all different terms of the quantum and the speed and timing of the emergence.
 Obviously we firmly believe that it is coming. Is it unstoppable? I don't think so.
 We live and work in Asia, all of us have for decades. And besides looking at the statistics you can just feel it on the ground on a daily basis in all the countries, whether it's advanced market or emerging market, just the consumerism, that consumption, the aspiration of people to do things for their children and themselves that was not able to be done before. So we're very bullish on the emergence of what essentially is our target market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Obviously, we do see a slight differentiation in between markets. I mentioned earlier about Indonesia be impacted by just the recent events, but I think it will pick up when the market picks up.
 I mean just to touch on China, despite the volatilities because of the middle class is not just the income, it's also the discretionary spending. For China for example, the part that is for basic necessity is actually decreased from a third to about 20%.
 So they've got more to spend. So it's not just the number, it's actually whether the discretionary spending are also increasing as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And then on the asset side we have a very benign balance sheet. Our shareholder funds are almost exclusively invested in local government bonds. So we don't have exposure to commodities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions please.
 Firstly on the Hong Kong business, the mainlanders, can you talk a little bit about the tension between the attracting clients and keeping on the right side of CRRC. Because you mentioned hiring agents with strong links to the mainland. How do you manage that from a compliance point of view?
 A second question just on Indonesia, there was a comment on one of the slides that the average number of clients per agent is 11 I think. I just wonder if you could give an idea of the shape of that, because that sounds like it's friends and family on average (multiple speakers) SKU that. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, let me take the Hong Kong think and Lilian can take the Indo one. I think it's a compliance question.
 We have a very clearly prescribed process and requirements for who can become an agent, testing procedures, etc. I think we are the market leader in terms of how we then execute the sales process. Every single sale in Hong Kong to mainlanders is videotaped.
 So it's clearly provable and demonstratable to the regulators where the transaction is taking place. The local regulator, the OCI has come in and inspected the process, conducted secret shopping, etc., etc. And we have received very good marks across the board.
 Frankly, from a strategic perspective it's our job to raise the entire industry and Hong Kong up to our standard because I don't worry about us falling short. I worry about, Mike touched on it earlier, about aberrant competitors doing something bizarre. So we operate at a very high standard and we're encouraging others to follow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The statistic you saw, which is I think 11 customers per agent, obviously in indignation Indonesia we've got a lot of new recruits and that's where that averaging is coming from. Remember this is a part-time agency model, so once they come in they train to be an agent and if they actually go through the first year where they decide to be a manager that is when they become more full-time and professional. If I quote some of our senior agents who either will have a client's portfolio of about 2,000 to 3,000 clients.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson, KBW. Three quick questions. I wonder if you could possibly give us the year-on-year growth rate in active agents in Indonesia, so just get a feel for where that is now.
 Second question is around the midyear, I think the CEO of Pru, the new CEO mentioned Mike, pensioned a strong Asian pensions pipeline. I think I might've been a bit confused on that issue, I just wonder if you can talk about the potential for future deals? Are there any available? If so, where, etc.?
 The third thing is I remember about a year ago you mentioned that you were going to roll out, or maybe two years ago, your Hong Kong industrial-strength agency model, sorry, your Indonesian industrial-strength agency model into Hong Kong and you mentioned China. And to what extent is the surge in agent numbers? We are seeing in Hong Kong a function of taking that intellectual capital from Indonesia to Hong Kong, and if so what's the next market we should be looking at for this?

 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't think we've given the year-on-year activation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You are going to have to wait for the answer to that. Apologies. But you are a patient man.
 In terms of the expansion of bancassurance around the region we have a dedicated team in PCA that does nothing but business development in regard for looking for new relationships. Most of the large Pan-Asia relationships are secured at this point in time. It certainly doesn't mean that there's opportunity elsewhere.
 Lilian mentioned we just did I think a precedent-setting bancassurance deal with a local bank in Vietnam for an extended period of time on great terms and conditions. So I think the opportunity going forward for banker will be more, to use a baseball term, more singles and doubles, more local-type deals and that's great. That said, I know you know this, some of these bancassurance deals have become quite expensive in the last couple of years and we take the perspective that they have to work from an economic standpoint.
 They have to work from a cultural standpoint. We have to be able to -- it has to be a symbiotic relationship with the bank. It cannot be a predatory relationship.
 So we will not and do not expect to win every single deal. We are in the hunt and we will bring deals. That makes sense for the business and for the shareholders.
 I think the other piece you touched on was the expansion of -- did you say industrial wholesale industrial? Yes, we call it the GA model in Indonesia, we call it the GA model which for all intent and purposes the franchising of agency. Slightly different and it's great because it's on a variable cost basis and not fixed cost like traditional agency.
 That is not a part of the Hong Kong growth. It is pretty much how Vietnam has been built over the years and we are rolling it out in China on a pilot basis right now. We had to work very closely with the regulator to get approval to do that but we are rolling that out.
 And I think that will be an important part of our future growth for agency, especially in the emerging markets where the agency turnover is quite high. And you cannot have a business model that leaves you stranded with fixed, a lot of fixed expense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And I think on top of that I think it's the Philippines. They are actually growing. Given also the similarity in terms of having a lot of islands in your country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks very much. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. A couple of questions, if I could, on Indonesia and one on Eastspring.
 On Indonesia, obviously you mentioned emerging persistency in claims experience different by geography. Are you signaling that the persistency is deteriorating or claims experience is deteriorating? Or is this a view on the rural expansion and particularly will you have to have a JV for the sharia business as you expand out into the regions?
 And the second question was on Eastspring. So I just want to check on this. I think Tony said that 85% of Eastspring's assets were local to Asia, but I see 12% of your assets are actually non-Asian life.
 So that probably means only 3% of the assets are actually nonlife insurance offshore investors. Is that correct or have I misunderstood that?
 And the Eastspring mutual fund products, presumably they are not sold currently through the agency. Is there a reason why not and is that something you've considered and what would the impact of that be? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, let's go first at the Indonesia question. And I think it's important when one looks at some of these countries Indonesia, India, China, they are not countries, they are continents and they are radically different social economic across the archipelagos or whatever it is.
 So you do have different experience. You would expect it. You get smaller case sizes as one becomes more rural.
 The collection of premiums can be more cash-based versus direct deposit because the banking infrastructures may not be evolved, etc. So you can see some slight variations based on the geography.
 That's not an Indonesia phenomenon, that's an India phenomenon as well. So we do, as Adrian talked about, we manage PEC, persistency expenses and claims. This is a bonusable KPIs for all the businesses.
 And we manage it very tightly because it we don't we don't get the emergence of profits and cash that follow. On the Eastspring thing I'll give that one to Guy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Guy Strapp,  Prudential plc - CEO, Eastspring Investments   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure. So I normally work of an approximate number of 90. So thanks, Adrian, you've got 87.
 That would be split. So about 10% would be UK life just off the back of the envelope. And then the residual 3% would pertain to clients outside of Asia.
 So there'd be some Latin American money there and a bit of European money. But by far and the way the bulk is Asian sourced. And that's that local penetration model.
 In terms of mutual funds, the life company do leverage the SICAV platform. So wherever possible we look for efficiency and economies of scale around that.
 We are exploring a new business opportunity around wealth in one of the Southeast Asian markets where we would arm the agents. And it is not a trivial proposition both from a regulatory point of view or from an education point of view. But to be able to arm and the agents with the ability to differentiate between selling a protection product and then selling a savings or a peer mutual fund product.
 There are some regulators that just won't allow that. Hong Kong has been an example where the two regulators have said, well, it's your turf and the other one said, no, it's your, so ICI and SFC have said it's yours and that's table tennis and we haven't had a resolution there. But wherever we can, particularly with the top tier of agents, what you are proposing is exactly where our thinking is in terms of leveraging that agency workforce.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let me be very clear on that point, though, because we are experimenting with this but where we do this it must be additive. It cannot be cannibalistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Guy Strapp,  Prudential plc - CEO, Eastspring Investments   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure. Proceed with caution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ming Zhu,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ming Zhu, Canaccord. Two questions please. Given all the market volatility and FX volatility you've seen in the last 12 months across Asia, what are the near-term key challenges you are currently facing in terms of growth?
 Second question is for those countries that have a very weak FX in the past 12 months and with the risk of higher inflation domestically, what's your pricing strategy in this region? And would you look to increase price in some of those countries and may take the volume hit?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Not to be trite but, frankly, the market volatility in terms of us growing our new business, especially on the insurance side, is a friend. We sell long-term regular premium as Mike went through earlier, and it actually provides a great opportunity for us to engage with our distributors and customers to talk about concepts like dollar cost averaging and just keeping the flows of billing.
 So in terms of near-term challenges we're not -- we have not seen any changes in the direction of the business through the nine months as you may have seen and not overly concerned about what that brings. In terms of the second part --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If I could just jump in on that one, I mean the FX is the FX. We just manage locally. I think the second part of that question is with regards to inflation.
 Most of our pricing covers the whole range of levels of premium. Where we do make changes, and there are places like Indonesia, we will raise the minimum K size because we don't want small sizes. So that's where we adjust for inflation is minimum case size.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, it's [Will] here from Goldman. Two questions. One, could you talk a little about the regulatory legal framework by which mainland Chinese can bring their cash to Hong Kong to buy your products? And is there any risk that could change in a more difficult way for you?
 And secondly and completely differently, in terms of your broader Asian markets are there any markets where the consumer will monetarily benefit from lower oil prices in terms of their potential disposable income? Is that something you've thought about and see coming through at all?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lower oil prices. Do you want to take that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The one country that benefits, and if you go around our operations around Asia, Vietnam is loving life now. Vietnam is just booming because oil prices have come down.
 That is an economy that's very dependent on the price of oil. And it really hurts people's pockets when oil prices are high. So they are definitely coming back to one country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But more broadly across Asia some of the countries have a significant -- the economies have a significant dependency on commodities like Indonesia and Malaysia. And I think we've definitely felt that coming through Indonesia.
 I think Lilian and Azim talked about the Consumer Sentiment Index falling as a result and how that's impacted basically front-line sales coming through. Interestingly Malaysia, which also has a dependency on commodities, has and a whole bunch of stuff going on with the PM and 1MDB and all kinds of stuff. After nine months our Malaysia business just continued to go from strength to strength.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And just finishing off on the commodities one, just watch the imports from China. That's the number we look at. Watch the imports from China month on month and it has been dropping.
 And really it's the Indonesian and the Malaysia actually exporting to China. That has a big impact.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Do you want to talk about the regulatory framework for the mainlanders bringing money over?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lilian Ng,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Insurance, Prudential Corporation Asia   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Obviously I think as the Hong Kong team said we are targeting a certain segment. So these are just the middle (inaudible), we are looking at the case size of about 20,000 to about 40,000. So some of this limitation restriction is not going to impact that customer segment that we are looking at.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alan Devlin,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. Alan Devlin from Barclays. Just one question.
 You gave the example in Indonesia of what are the earnings with 5% AP growth and 15%. If AP was flat would that be sufficient to drive growth?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You have to look at it year on year but more or less it would, yes. Some growth, if you actually look it's fairly flat the actual in-force. It drops very slowly. So any little bit of AP would actually be okay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But let me be clear on Indonesia. While it is a complicated time with the economy and so on and so forth we don't expect AP to be flat ad infinitum.
 And I think as Lilian said earlier we are seeing some very good indicators of upticks in agency productivity and so on and so forth. So that's not the scenario that we're planning for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Any the last one for this session?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colm Kelly,  UBS - Analyst   [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, it's Colm Kelly from UBS. Just a question on IFRS. I know it was a key focus at the Asia financials presentation and Mike also talked about the alignment of earnings growth and dividend growth and that being a key feature. If we look at the product structure for the health and protection products a lot of the costs associated with selling those are recouped upfront and that supports the high IRRs and low payback periods.
 If we think about the new accounting framework down the line IFRS 4 Phase II and the possibility that profits are now spread more evenly over a contract, how should I be thinking about the impacts of that for IFRS earnings growth over a three- to five-year period and the potential then for maybe a misalignment with dividend growth, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adrian O'Connor,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential Corporation Asia   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I personally think you cannot look at, and I'm not going to get into the IFRS 4 Phase II discussion until it actually all happens, you cannot look at one product line in isolation to the whole picture because that would give the wrong impression totally. So in fairness I'm not going to get into the disclosure. We are having discussions with the whole thing and the whole thing hasn't been completed for us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So now we will break for lunch. So just across the room. And I'd appreciate it if all of you could be back here at two o'clock.
================================================================================
Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Foley,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't know if you're irritated by that music. If you are spare a thought for us. It's the way Mike announces himself in the mornings.
 I'm the new boy and I will invoke the new boy privilege of co-presenting today. And I will do that with Aki Hussain who is our CFO. And for Q&amp;A we will be joined by John Warburton who is the head of our distribution.
 I am the new boy so by way of personal background I've been with Prudential for 16 years, much of that time in senior leadership roles. In 2009 I made the leap from banking to insurance when that trade wasn't particularly fashionable. And I made the move to Prudential mostly on the basis of my knowledge of Pru UK.
 Pru UK has a lot of clout and it had a lot of clout back then. Like many of our existing and prospective customers, our regulators and business partners I'm firmly of the opinion that Prudential UK is a significant force in the market. Hence, I took the job.
 So this is our agenda. I will talk to the first two sections and Aki will cover performance and the proposition and distribution updates and I will come back and briefly summarize at the end. However, before getting into the agenda in any detail I want to outline our proposition upfront so as to provide you with the context for this presentation.
 Now, close followers of this group have become accustomed to regarding the UK as a reliable source of cash, focused on managing its existing customers. In recent times, and quite understandably, you may have thought of us as neither positioned for growth nor striving to reach new retail customers. Aki and I are here today to explain to you that that situation has changed.
 Yes, this is still a highly cash-generative business and, yes, the back book is crucially important to that cash generation. And you will get plenty of color on this later. However, the recent radical changes in our marketplace offer a business with our unique combination of capabilities, a new and significant opportunity for profitable and capital efficient growth.
 And furthermore, this growth is supported by a structural shift in the new business profile relative to our business a few years ago. So our business our retail business pre-freedoms was dominated by bonds and annuities. Post-freedoms we have moved to a more balanced portfolio of bonds, ISA, pension savings, pension drawdown with much lower volumes of annuities.
 And what underpins our ability to capture this growth opportunity are three hard-to-replicate opportunities. First, with profit or PruFund platform that gives us the ability to create products perfectly tailored for the customers of the pension freedom world. In the past year we have made two significant enhancements that have broadened access to our proposition: making PruFund available through an ISA wrapper and through a drawdown product.
 Now PruFund through an ISA wrapper has been a huge successful product launch, attracting sizable new fund flows. And we were number one in the rapidly growing UK market for income drawdown in Q3 2015. In addition, we launched other variations making this our busiest year of product development.
 Now freed of the requirement to buy an annuity customers want easier access to their retirement savings but at the same time they are seeking insurance against the extreme volatility of markets. The demand is there and through PruFund we are providing a differentiated and market-leading set of solutions.
 Second is our outstanding long-term investment performance. Over the long term, our with-profit fund has been an out performer of the market. Over a period spanning nearly 20 years, our asset share fund has outperformed the median investment return of our peer group by an average of just over 100 basis points per annum.
 The fund also consistently beat its benchmark by an average of 40 basis points per annum over that same time frame. This translates into materially better outcomes for our customers.
 Third is our brilliant distribution capabilities. Through the combination of our intermediated and direct channels, we have weathered the changes brought on by RDR. Our IFA relationships now exceed pre-RDR levels both in number and quality of relationships.
 Now as evidence of this, in November 2015 we were voted Company of the year in an annual survey of intermediaries conducted by FTAdviser. In the direct channels our Prudential financial planning unit is building significant momentum with sales increasing by more than 70% in the first nine months of 2015. Those are the main messages I want to land with you this afternoon.
 You have my slides in your pack, so I will now run through them at pace. You are all very familiar with our UK business. It's a significant operation with over 7 million policyholders for whom we have delivered excellent investment returns over the medium term as our track record clearly demonstrates.
 In doing this we leverage other group capabilities including M&amp;G, Eastspring and PPMA. But significantly also PPMG, Prudential Portfolio Management Group. It is PPMG that develops the strategic asset allocation for the GBP150 billion of funds that we have under management and is the source of much of the performance success.
 We have a terrific brand. Ask anyone in our customer segment, Prudential really is a household name. And as I've already said, we have great intermediated distribution capability.
 We also have a fast-growing advice channel that has provided the antidote to many customer concerns since pension freedom were announced. Indeed, I'm looking forward to participating in my first distribution sales academy in Scotland later this week where 350 of our top performers get together to share their ideas and plans for the year ahead.
 Finally, our financial strength. We deliver strong, predictable, free surplus and cash generation alongside our significant with-profit fund. Now even in today's capital regime, the with-profit fund is highly capital efficient and through this fun we will continue to write new investment business.
 But as you know and as my colleagues have pointed out previously, the environment is not benign. Market volatility is on the rise and likely to continue. Low interest rates, I think, will be around for quite a while longer. And we need to be mindful of how this macroeconomic environment will affect customer needs and behaviors and the construct of our investment portfolios.
 Now nothing on this slide will be new to you. So I will make three points if I may. First, my view is that these regulatory and government interventions, both large and small, will benefit the well-known, financially strong firms as more transparency and competition comes to the sector.
 Second, customers will quickly develop their hierarchy of needs for the security of their financial futures, which will rapidly lead to my third point that customer behavior and customer expectations will change. Consumers enabled by technology and greater access to information will increase their expectations of companies they do business with. It follows, and not unreasonably, that consumers will compare the service they receive from the financial services industry with the service they receive from the best companies they deal with and we need to improve here.
 As I said at the beginning, the opportunity for the Prudential that is thrown up by the change and changing environment emphasizes savings and investments. And that opportunity, as I've already said, plays to our strengths.
 Let me give you to relevant statistics underpinning this opportunity. First, the UK is the world's fifth largest retail investment market. Second, the population growth rate in our target over 50s demographic is 1.4% per annum, almost double the growth rate of the UK population as a whole.
 I can tell you as the new boy that our people in the various locations have already worked this out for themselves. They are excited about developing new initiatives, products and services that will resonate strongly with our customers, both existing and new, and the energy levels among these teams is frighteningly high.
 This in a nutshell is the opportunity. To be very clear about Prudential's edge in converting this opportunity into business, it's the combination of our investment skills demonstrated by our track record, our distribution capabilities and our ability to smooth volatility. So the customer proposition is great investment performance, access to a true multi-asset fund and a return less impacted by market gyrations.
 The last thing I want to explain to you is the model we will follow to ensure we deliver to this strategy consistently over time. There's nothing complicated here. We will concentrate on the two segments I've been talking about: retail growth on the one hand and management of the in-force on the other.
 This is about making sure we use our resources appropriately and with the right focus. Given what I've said about the opportunity, I'm sure you can immediately see why this model makes sense. It will ensure we focus on our core investment in distribution skills, the customer proposition and our deep knowledge of key insurance risks.
 I don't propose to go through this slide in detail but I'd like to make two important points before handing over to Aki who will anyway cover some of the points on this model in his section. First point, the point of this approach is not as simplistic as cost management. The point is to optimize and better focus our resources.
 Second, with all the capability at management's disposal, we will also be responsive to other non-core opportunities that might come our way as a result of what I can only describe as Prudential power, the power that comes from being an organization with clout.
 And with that I will hand you over to Aki.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aki Hussain,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, I thought I'd get a bit of music while I was pouring my water. Thank you, John, and good afternoon everybody. I'm going to provide a brief run through of our business performance over the first nine months of 2015, some insight into how that performance has been achieved and a brief update on the business implications of Solvency II and pension freedoms.
 Now as you just heard from John, the last few years have been years of fundamental change to our market and the full effect of those changes will emerge over the next few years. But what we're already seeing is quite significant change in consumer behavior. But despite all of these changes which have included RDR, pension freedoms and latterly Solvency II, the UK business has continued to deliver a very robust level of sales.
 Indeed, in each of these challenging years we've delivered well in excess of GBP650 million of retail APE and in 2015 we're on track to deliver considerably more. At the nine-month market in 2015 retail sales were up 26% and that's despite experiencing a further 50% fall in retail annuities.
 Now the decline in retail annuities, which is broadly consistent with the market, hasn't changed the underlying reality for customers. They still need income in their retirement. But they are using the new freedoms to place their long-term savings in a range of alternative products.
 And it's in these alternative products that we as a business are very well-placed and we have a range of market-leading, differentiated consumer propositions which have enabled us to grow what we call our retail growth propositions or risk managed investment solutions by 65% year over year. And that's over and above the 40% growth we saw in this same group of products in 2014. So as you can see, we are experiencing or we are changing the mix in our new business franchise.
 If I just turned to our remaining products for a moment, if you look at the chart on the right you can see that at the nine-month mark we experienced a modest decline in our sales volumes in corporate pensions. We remain focused on maintaining our position here and maximizing the potential opportunity available to us. We continue to have a strong presence in the public sector with our AVC proposition.
 And finally on bulks, our stance on bulks remains as it has been for a number of years which is one of selective participation only in a writing business that meets our strict financial return requirements. We've continued through that process with that philosophy in 2015, delivering a robust performance with APE of GBP149 million.
 I'm just going to digress from my presentation for a moment to address the announcement this afternoon from the Chancellor around exit fees on pensions. Now this is -- or early exit fees on pensions.
 Now this is still something that we're evaluating in terms of what this means but I thought I'd just give you some insight as to the potential implications of the UK business. So firstly, in terms of workplace pensions we had taken a decision some months ago to remove all exit fees and all of those will be removed by the middle of this year.
 In terms of AVCs I think AVC is the only one that's excluded. Exit fees are capped at 3% and the total impact of making those changes is embedded value impact of less than GBP7 million.
 Then the remaining book, the individual pensions book, for 98% of that book exit fees range between zero and 2%. This business is largely written within the ring-fenced fund. Any potential implications will be de minimis on the shareholder balance sheet.
 I will get back on track now. In terms of retail annuities, I will come back to retail and bulk annuities later on in the presentation. For the moment I want to, I would like to unpack the growth in our risk managed investment solutions.
 So as you can see the 65% growth has come from a broad range of product. Taking each of these in turn, firstly bonds. Now what's providing an attractive return to consumers, they are an essential part of an advisors toolkit, providing tax efficient investment and inheritance solutions and we've seen sales increase by 15%.
 The recent market changes have made long-term savings more attractive. That combined with the product enhancements that we've undertaken this year have enabled us to double our sales of individual pensions. The shift away from retail annuities to income drawdown has opened up the intermediated retirement income market.
 And here we have fantastic proposition which has been further enhanced by the launch of our Flexi-access Drawdown product earlier in 2015. That combined with the strength of our distribution capability has enabled us to treble the sales and establish ourselves as one of the, if not the, market leader in what is a fast-growing area.
 Now you will recall from our previous Investor Day where we announced our intention to launch the PruFund in ISA wrapper. This was duly launched at the end of February. It's been very well received in the market both by intermediaries and consumers.
 And, in fact, in seven short months since launch end of February to end of September we've accumulated in the region of GBP450 million of assets under management. But as you know this is barely scratching the surface of what is nearly a GBP500 billion market, so there's plenty of room for growth.
 So as you can see, we've been taking advantage of the changes in the market combined with our own product development and enhancements to drive a shift in our new business franchise from one where retail annuities were certainly a core focus to a new business franchise now which is more capital efficient and meeting the changing needs of consumers.
 If you look at the chart on the left, as you can see the growth in what we call our risk managed investment solutions was emerging slowly over time but with a marked increase over the last couple of years as a result of the changes in the market, very importantly, the broadening of our consumer propositions.
 Now we expect demand for our products to continue to be fueled by the growth in our target demographic which is the 50-plus age range. You heard John refer to that earlier on today. Also by the continued need and continued demand for low risk, low volatility, long-term savings and retirement income solutions and, finally, by the strength of our propositions.
 Now key to our success has been our modern with-profits funds which I call the PruFunds. They are market-leading, they are the differentiated and they are meeting consumer needs.
 Let me turn to the core components of our business now and I will begin with the with-profits. With-profits has been and will continue to be a fundamental part of our offering. The with-profits fund is a unique asset by virtue of its size, standing at over GBP100 billion, by its access to assets as a result of its financial strength and financial flexibility using the inherited estate of over GBP700 billion and due to the long-term track record of investment performance.
 Now John referred to this earlier. And he referenced the circa 100 basis points versus points out-performance relative to the median of our peers. Over what is a 19-year period in pounds and pennies that translates into in excess of GBP10 billion over that period of investment performance, which is a fantastic result for our customers and also a great result for shareholders.
 Importantly, our with-profits business is largely unaffected by Solvency II. Indeed, the financial strength and financial flexibility of the with-profits fund is a mostly unchanged and new business remains highly capital efficient.
 Now our with-profits fund is a genuine multi-asset fund. This provides the ordinary retail investor with access to a well diverse portfolio of real assets with material exposure to alternatives, alternatives including greenfield and brownfield infrastructure, private equity, hedge funds and physical property. These are asset classes that the ordinary investor would find very difficult to get access to.
 Indeed, it would be near impossible through other propositions because of the scale and liquidity required. But, ultimately, the success of the with-profits fund is measured through the investment performance, the investment returns provided to customers, the volatility of those returns and also the 1/9 cash transfer to shareholders.
 Now the success of our with-profits fund or rather their three key ingredients behind the success of the with-profits fund. And they are firstly the financial strength and financial flexibility. This allows us to adopt investment strategies with a bias towards equity type assets, it allows us to avoid taking procyclical action and it allows us to moderate the volatility of returns to consumers.
 The second key ingredient is asset allocation. Now we have excellent multi-asset capability within the group in the form of Prudential Portfolio Management Group, PPMG, you heard John refer to them earlier. That team advises us on the asset allocation for the with-profits fund and investment strategy more generally.
 And we also have first-rate experience and capability in the alternative space, again within PPMG combined with the M&amp;G real estate team. This provides real bench strength to our investment capabilities.
 Finally, we have the active stock selection through our range of in-house asset managers, M&amp;G, PPMA and Eastspring, also with selective use of third-party specialist. And it's this combination of capabilities built up over a very long period of time, which is difficult to replicate and provides us with this unique asset of the with-profits fund.
 If you turn to the chart on the right, most of you will be aware the with-profits fund has been for some time a key source of high-quality IFRS earnings, free surplus and cash flow. It will continue to be a source of predictable earnings, free surplus and cash flow over the long period of time. And as you can see if you look at the deep red on the top, as the older business is beginning to mature it is now being replaced by a new PruFunds business, and over time we expect that deep red bar to grow quite significantly.
 Turning to PruFunds in a little more detail, since their launch in the mid-2000s the PruFund proposition has provided leading investment performance to our customers against any industry comparatives. Indeed, the smoothing mechanism within the PruFunds has provided protection to policyholders in what has been an uncertain and volatile investment environment.
 And this has been incredibly well received as is demonstrated by the continuous growth in assets under management which at the end of September 2015 touched nearly GBP15 billion and, of course, the number of policies and customers invested in the PruFunds which are now in excess of 0.25 million.
 This business is also not reaching a scale and a degree of maturity where it is beginning to generate material volumes of cash and earnings. The PruFunds, of course, are a range of different fund options risk-rated, with or without guarantees, cautious or growth. They are also accessible through a variety of different tax wrappers.
 What all this means is we're able to address a wide range of the consumers needs. And this all adds to the success of our PruFunds.
 If I now turn to the next key component of our business which is annuities and, firstly, I will talk to retail annuities new business. Now our position here is a function of two key drivers: firstly, customer preference post-pension freedoms and, secondly, the implications of Solvency II.
 So as you can see in the chart on the left, we have experienced post-pension freedoms two successive years of 50% falls in our retail annuities. Retail annuities now in 2015 represented a mere 7% of our total retail sales. So as soon as compulsion has been removed the vast majority of our customers no longer see annuities as their product of choice for providing income in their retirement.
 Now in terms of Solvency II as you heard earlier from Nic the financial resource requirement for writing annuities under Solvency II has increased materially. Also the lockup period for that capital has lengthened and the risk margin itself introduces a new source of interest rate sensitivity onto the balance sheet. So taking these two factors together customers, customer preferences and, secondly, the changing economics, taking these two together has reduced our own appetite for writing this product in the future.
 If we now turn to the Solvency II implications on the back book, I think about this in two segments. The first is illustrated by the chart at the top. So the best estimate liability and SCR under Solvency II is broadly similar to the BEL plus ICA plus ICG under Solvency I, so that's Solvency I, pillar two. The capital and margins emerge in a similar time frame and to a similar level under both of these solvency regimes.
 But, of course, under Solvency II we're required to hold a new technical provision in the form of the risk margin. But for the back book the risk margin is broadly offset by the transitional deduction. And the transitional deduction also provides a very effective interest rate hedge against significant rate movements given both the EIOPA and PRA racedowns on the recalculation of transitional deductions. Now, of course, both the risk margin and the transitional deduction are running off and from time to time there will be modest mismatches which will need to be managed.
 In summary, the Solvency II impact on our annuity back book is modest. We continue to see are in-force annuities as a key source of resilient IFRS earnings, free surplus and cash flow generation over the long term. Now, of course, there are capital models and capital charges have been agreed following model approval we also have a range of optimization activities that we either are executing at present or evaluating prior to discussion with the regulator and we'll be executing during the course of the year.
 Turning to bulk annuities, as I mentioned earlier our position here remains unchanged. It is one of selective participation and as you can see that demonstrated in the chart on the left. We continue to maintain our financial discipline.
 Now, the Solvency II implications for writing new retail annuity business equally apply to bulk annuities. In the face of the changing economics, we are not changing our financial return requirements. We would expect over the long term or over the medium term for the market to evolve and reflect the new realities.
 Now turning to distribution, we have a diverse distribution capability comprising both intermediated and direct channels led by my colleague John Warburton. Now undoubtedly our key strength has been our intermediary relationships where in 2015 we'd seen sales increase by over 50%. This is complemented by our direct-to-consumer channels.
 Firstly, Prudential Financial Planning. This is a new channel that we set up in 2012. This is the third full-year operation and we are seeing significant momentum in this face-to-face channel where we have seen sales grow by over 70%.
 Finally, we have a retail voice channel which is our direct-to-consumer telephony capability. This has been affected by the shift away from annuities, so whilst we've decreased the size of this channel it remains a proven telephony distribution capability, one that remains core to our direct-to-consumer proposition and is also complementary to Prudential Financial Planning.
 So taking these together, we have a robust and diverse distribution capability. And it's one of our key strengths in growing our retail sales volumes.
 Now turning to the intermediary channel in a little more detail, one of the key reasons for our success in this channel has been the operating model that we deploy. We call this the power of three. And this comprises a regional account manager, a telephony account manager and a sales support executive working together as a team.
 And this is called the regional sales unit. And they have been instrumental in establishing the strong and growing relationships in the intermediary community.
 Now this is an operating model that we established some eight years ago. And it's seen continuous investment and evolution of it at period of time. And we've demonstrated to the intermediary community that we are here for the long term with high-quality people and high-quality product.
 Indeed, each of these regional account managers and telephony account managers are qualified to the same level as the financial advisors. We have 65 RSUs across the country which provide us with 100% coverage and this is certainly a model that we know others are now looking to replicate.
 If you look to the chart on the right, the growth in sales volumes in this channel has been emerging over a long period of time but once again with the marked acceleration over the last two, three years. Again, I will repeat myself, this is due to market changes, the broadening of our consumer proposition but also importantly the growing maturity of our operating model.
 And before I move off this page, I'd just like to draw your attention to the chart in the middle. So by the end of September 2015, the number of intermediaries using Prudential on a monthly basis had for the first time exceeded pre-RDR levels. And this has been an important milestone for us.
 Turning to Prudential Financial Planning in a little more detail, as I mentioned earlier this is a new channel. It's a face-to-face channel. It's effectively the new man or person from the Pru.
 We set this up to broaden our distribution capabilities. And as you can see now it's become a sizable business in its own right with 240 salaried advisors at the end of September, nearly GBP3 billion assets under advice and nearly 40,000 clients under advice.
 This capability positions us well to take advantage of our very significant direct back book opportunity and also to cater for the needs of new to franchise consumers. It also positions us very well to seize on any opportunities that might emerge from the financial advice market review.
 Now turning to propositions and channel development, now Tulsi Naidu and the propositions team have had a very busy couple of years and a very successful couple of years broadening our consumer propositions. As you heard me say over the last couple of years we have launched PruFund ISA, Flexi-Access Drawdown, recently the pension choices plan which is a simplified, non-advised version of our drawdown and a whole host of other new products and product variations.
 We've also taken significant action to improve consumer and intermediary experience. On the customer servicing side one of our key developments has been the pilot relative enhancements to MyPru. This will allow our customers to have secure online access to their existing products in order to undertake servicing changes.
 If I look into 2016, key developments here are, firstly, the launch of our new policy administration system based on modern platform technology. All our new products will be launched on this platform, the first of which will be the retirement account which is a SIPP with a PruFund at its core and a range of other fund options. This will be launched in the first half of this year.
 Looking into the second half we will continue to broaden our channel capability, our distribution capability with the launch of our D2C online capability. This will be accompanied by a suite of non-advised simplified investment solutions.
 Finally, we will continue to develop our PFP channel. At the end of September we had 240 salaried advisors. By the end of 2015 we had 251 and this will continue to grow broadly at that rate in 2016.
 And finally, on to industry recognition. 2015 has been another good year for us and this is testament to the hard work and dedication of colleagues up and down the country and in Mumbai.
 On the servicing side we retained our two, five-star awards -- five-star servicing awards for investments in life and pensions and in 2015 we also gained recognition as the Company of the year. Our developments and progress in the online space has been recognized by the FTAdviser online award where once again we received the Company of the year award.
 And then on the product side in 2014 we gained five-star Defaqto recognition for a couple of our products. We've added two further products, sorry, we retained those rewards and we added two further products in the form of the offshore investment bond and the SIPP.
 That brings my piece to an end. Thank you very much for listening. And I will hand back to John.

 Ladies and gentlemen, we have run out of time a little bit, so we've had a lot to tell you. I just want to say thank you for your attention.
 What you've heard today is the reason I took the job. I think it's a fantastic proposition and I'm looking forward to answering any questions that you may have in that section later on. Thank you.

 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, thank you very much. I am simply not stepping up on here with that ludicrous music. It makes me feel like sort of a heavyweight boxer, you know the dry ice and sort, coming into the ring and maybe that's what it's going to be like.
 Good afternoon everybody. I think many of you know me already. We seem to have been around here for an awfully long time.
 Got half an hour to talk to you, try and address some of your concerns. Grant Speirs, who is M&amp;G Finance Director, will talk to the financials in the third section. I'm going to get straight to the point which is why we are experiencing retail net outflows of the moment which I know will be your concern.
 I want to talk a bit about the breadth of the business because it is I think an underrated factor with M&amp;G. And then after Grant I will sweep up with a look forward.
 So M&amp;G is as you all know well diversified business, three different blocks of assets there: the internal client on the left, the retail business in the middle and the wholesale on the right. Coincidently at the end of September the wholesale and the retail were almost exactly balanced. And you will see from your handouts there that the diversification of assets within each of those categories is very significant.
 I'm going to focus on retail just for a minute because that's actually obviously the main point of value at issue at the moment. And in doing that I'm going to focus on four points, give you a bit of context, and talk about the M&amp;G Optimal Income Fund which has been a phenomenal success, but which is where the net outflows are particularly concentrated at the moment, a bit about equity fund performance and then a word on our multi-asset range where we are experiencing some good growth and we have some good prospects.
 So first of all, the context. It's nice just to go back and look at the history of this business, really since pretty much since the Pru's owned it, actually the Pru bought M&amp;G in 1999. But I do remember that wondrous year in 2005 when net sales on the retail side of the business first went through GBP1 billion and little did we know what lay in store and the phenomenal fund flows that came in in the years after that.
 From the UK but I guess particularly from Europe we opened our doors in Europe in 2002. It's been purely organic growth and we've seen some amazing growth over there. So that just puts the current situation into a bit of context. And then at the end of the third quarter last year we disclosed net outflows on the retail book of about GBP7.5 billion.
 This is as much for my benefit as anyone else's actually because I do sometimes have to pinch myself when I remember that when the Pru bought M&amp;G the retail book of M&amp;G was just over GBP7 billion. So the growth over the period and market movements have resulted in that retail book in the short term topping out at about GBP74 billion and today, well, at the end of the third quarter we're looking at GBP63.5 billion.
 So by any measure, the growth has been very significant. And the fact is that today we are giving some of that back. But I guess those of you who know me couldn't accuse me of not having alerted you to the fact that at some point this would happen.
 So the M&amp;G Optimal Income Fund, this has been a phenomenal fund. It was launched in December 2006, managed by Richard Woolnough from the outset, distributed into both UK and Europe but particularly the growth has come from Europe. And Europe is represented on that diagram by the blue part under the line.
 And it reached its peak in December 2014, GBP24.7 billion under management. So from a standing start in December 2006 that had become the largest mutual fund in the whole of Europe.
 Today, or rather I should say 2015, it had come down to just over GBP18 billion. It was still the sixth largest mutual fund, still a very sizable fund. And you just have got to put that into the long-term context of the growth this fund has experienced.
 So why is the money going out? I don't think it is particularly due to performance. We've shown the performance numbers there at the top.
 The way that Richard has been running that fund he hasn't had a great one year but it's not a disaster. He's positioned the shorter end of the curve, short duration, long of credit, those positions weren't particularly great last year and he gave a bit back. But the medium- and long-term performance is still extremely good.
 And you can see really why investors are putting money into that fund from the moment it was launched. In excess of 7% absolute return since launch. And the curious thing about the fund is that it was actually delivering roughly 7% every year, it's not just a long-term average figure.
 But when, of course, interest rates were perceived whether in reality or not, I guess we will establish when the current volatility of uncertainty plays through, but when interest rates were perceived to have bottomed around the end of the first quarter last year this fund as the largest fund was the go-to fund as it had been on the way out.
 And if you remember, and there is continuing to be significant discussion about liquidity in bond funds and what happens, will it be possible for managers to deal if there's a so-called exodus of money coming out of the funds, and again this fund bore the brunt of quite a lot of that comment. So it was the sort of go-to fund to come out of and the outflows started in March and have really been unremitting since then.
 It would have been good during this period if we could have enjoyed some strong inflows into one or two. We have had some good inflows into one or two of our funds, but actually it would be nice if we could of had some strong inflows into one or two of our flagship equity funds which themselves have grown very strongly over the course of the last decade.
 Now a number of you out there will be on the buy side and indeed many of you will know just how difficult markets have been. A number of our large equity funds are invested with a so-called value bias it. That doesn't mean to say they are out and out value funds, but traditional concepts of undervalued stocks are applied.
 Yes there have been some bad stock selection decisions. Everyone makes those. But fundamentally the value style has been having a very rough ride for a sustained period of time.
 And you can see on the left there, I'm sure you're familiar with it, it just simply tracks the performance of the value over growth index relative to falling yields, the rise and rise of bond-like equities with perceived reliable growth characteristics. And on the right you can see that the underperformance of value to growth is an exceptionally long period by historical standards. We're only going back to 1985, but it is I think this is the longest period of underperformance by the value index for some decades.
 Will it turn? I don't know. Your judgment on that is likely to be as good as mine. But that explains why we've had some outflows on some of our flagship equity funds.
 Multi-asset, there's a lot of talk about this throughout Europe. It's a significant growth opportunity for us. We've got a very capable multi-asset team applying a proven and unique methodology.
 We have a range of funds across the full gamut from defensive to growth balanced in between. And here we've just shown the growth of assets under management in our multi-asset range in Europe since January 2014. So it's not a fund optimal income scales, but actually it's growing very nicely and we continue to see good prospects there.
 So the breadth of the business is my next topic just to highlight that a little bit. Three headings for that: the first is this European footprint that we've built up since we first went into Europe back in 2002; the second is our wholesale business, which has got a fine record for innovation and I think has an unrivaled position in the UK market for innovating in the fixed income markets; and then a rather sort of underplayed theme historically is our property business where I see -- where I'm bullish and I see a lot of fun, interesting opportunities.
 The European footprint we've built up. I mean those numbers are fairly simple. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that the opportunity in Europe in terms of scale of assets under management, relative marketshares, notwithstanding the fact that in Europe we have established a significant market position.
 We have got brand recognition. We have got a serious network of distribution capability links with all the big wealth management houses. Many of you who go skiing will be absolutely bored with seeing M&amp;G advertisements all over the ski slopes.
 Europe remains a significant opportunity for us. And if you believe in the simplification of the savings model, the unwrapping of savings vehicles and the need for an aging population in Europe to save, you have to be optimistic about prospects in Europe.
 And I thought it would be helpful if we just looked at the growth of the position that we built up in Europe since 2008. Those are the main markets where we are now operating. We're in a number of markets but those are our most significant positions.
 And you can see there that the assets under management we have accumulated and the market position we now enjoy is highly significant. Some of these numbers like France and Italy, and this is all organic, no acquisitions at all. So Europe clearly remains a good opportunity for us.
 The wholesale business, it's a nice business and it's got some very good performance numbers in a range of both the public and private alternative fixed income and quasi-fixed income assets. And I think probably a range of expertise as I said at the start that I think is pretty much unrivaled in the UK market.
 Just giving you here some idea of the many different activities that they carry out. And in each of these areas they have interesting products and good performance and they are growing well and there is a good pipeline of business.
 An example of our skills in this area would be the Alpha Opportunities Fund which brings together our skills in that top row of activities and packages, together for institutional clients. That I guess is the closest we get to offering a product that brings most of these skills together.
 We have seen some very good demand in the institutional market, very, very steady growth, continuing good pipeline of business. So we've gone from GBP750 million a few years ago, we are already at GBP4.1 billion and there's still a pipeline of clients queuing to get in.
 And the performance numbers I guess give you some idea why. In an era of low returns this is very much a fund that floats the consultant's boat in the fixed income market.
 Property I mentioned. We are a leading property player. We are top 10 in Europe.
 We've got -- we cover the markets, we cover the range of property assets comprehensively. We have a very good reputation in this field.
 Property I guess is I think going to remain more interesting because of the quasi-fixed income characteristics that attach to property in an era of likely continuing low yields and low returns. And our property business does work closely with our fixed income -- our wholesale fixed income business to produce hybrid products.
 When I look at property it is a less competed market, it's a less competed industry I think in the UK and I think in Europe and actually I think globally compared to equities or fixed income or other such mainstream asset classes. And why is that? Why are there fewer players out there who are regarded as credible operators in this market?
 I've tried to summarize the reasons why I think that's the case and why we are one of them. The first point I made, though, is a sort of chicken and egg point. You can't get into the industry unless you are in it already.
 Institutions are very reluctant to give you chunky sums of money to invest in physical bricks-and-mortar unless you've already got a fund and already got a demonstrated track record. That's a fairly obvious point.
 But it is a specialist game. It's not simply about buying properties in the obvious cities. It's about knowing what the trends are in the market, having a well-established research capability, but actually managing the assets.
 Slightly confusing expression asset management when we're all in an industry which is asset management. But asset management in a property sense is about actually doing things to a property to improve the property, to increase the yields, to increase the rental stream to make it attractive for prospective tenants. And there is some specialist skills here that we have got a good position in.
 Off-market contacts are absolutely vital. You have to be a trusted go-to counterparty for the property agents, the big players in the market for the people who -- also for the people owning the assets. So they will come in phone us up first before anyone else if there is an asset of interest coming on the market or that we want to get rid off and when the flows work the other way.
 You've got to be able to execute quickly and you've got to have a reputation for executing quickly. Easier said than done. And you've got to have long-term staying power.
 What does that mean?, Well, property lends itself to gearing, as we know. Many people have tried to be big players in this property industry and have gotten fat.
 They overgive the funds, the track record crashes and burns and they withdraw. And that's left to a relatively small number of players with the long-term staying power of whom we are undoubtedly one.
 Now as I said we do work very closely with our wholesale fixed income business and the M&amp;G secured property income fund, or SPIF, is a very good example of this. This is really hit the buttons for pension funds, for institutions with long-term liabilities that need matching. And we are buying effectively, well, we are buying freehold properties with long leasehold clients.
 Could be sale and lease back transactions, good credit risk and some kind of inflation linking in the lease clause. That means the transaction offers long-term inflation linked hedging for institutions with long-term liabilities.
 This fund has been highly successful. Again, it won't -- compared to that dramatic optimal income chart it looks modest by comparison. But this has been a very steady grower and remains a steady grower.
 The buff colored part of that chart is the queue of capital we've got waiting to come in. It varies, it fluctuates from month to month. But fundamentally you can see that there is a queue out there continuing to feed the steady growth of this fund on good margins.
 With that, I'm going to hand over the podium to Grant. And then I will come back for a look forward.

 Grant Speirs,  Prudential plc - Group Finance Director, M&amp;G Investments   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon. Not much really for me to say since you've heard a lot from Michael already and, in fact, you've already heard the secret to asset management in terms of growth from our colleagues in Asia. The fact is there is no secret to what drives growth in an asset management company. It's a very, very simple formula.
 It starts with delivering good investment performance over the medium to long term and products that our clients want and need. It sounds simple, obviously not always that easy to achieve. However, if you get those two components right over the longer term you should be able to accumulate assets.
 The remaining two ingredients to grow the business is quite simply run pricing and costs. From a pricing perspective it is very important to ensure that you price to asset management capabilities at a commercial rate. It's not about accumulating assets irrespective of price.
 It is about having pricing discipline and if necessary turning away opportunities if it doesn't meet your commercial imperatives. And finally, from a cost perspective, it's just being sensible about managing the cost base.
 It would be wonderful if we could have it all as variable. Clearly you can't, but building in variability into your cost base again is fundamentally important.
 So the end product out of all of those factors is profits. Very, very simple. You've seen the asset accumulation profile that Michael showed earlier on, tremendous growth across both the retail and the institutional or wholesale books over the past decade.
 M&amp;G's profits have transformed, more than doubled since 2009. And I think what is pleasing there is it shows that it's actually the underlying revenue or underlying profits that have really been behind the growth. We aren't reliant on one of fee income in the form of PRS or carried interest to generate revenue stream, that really is the underlying business.
 So a transformation in terms of profits. Certainly points to a business that has grown at a tremendous rate over the past five years or so. And given that we can't share financials, there's perhaps another way of looking and just giving some sense as to the scale of the change that M&amp;G has enjoyed or experienced over the past number of years.
 So this shows a snapshot of M&amp;G as at the end of 2009 and compares it to where we were at the half-year in 2015. So during that period we've opened up six new offices in countries that we didn't have a presence in before.
 From a retail fund registration perspective we've entered into nine new territories to distribute our product. Typically on the back of demand are request from some of our global distributors, and so they want to be serviced by M&amp;G people on the ground in those regions and we move in on the back of that. In addition to that, we obtained marketing passports or registered wholesale funds for distribution in 15 new territories.
 Since the end of 2009 there have been 57 new fund launches across both wholesale and retail. In terms of number of new share classes, a staggering 528. That's a fairly significant change in our retail book of business.
 Finally, from an administration point of view our front, middle and back office systems have had to accommodate around 27,500 new securities over their time frame. All of those above initiatives have really been in support of M&amp;G's asset accumulation efforts and to ensure that M&amp;G continues to offer a product range that clients want and we offer product features that suit their requirements and their needs.
 As you've already seen, that strategy has been pretty successful with external assets under management practically doubling since the end of 2009. That is unfortunately, however, not the only reality that the industry and M&amp;G have had to deal with over the past several years. The regulatory environment for asset management companies or the asset management industry is fundamentally changed and continues to evolve.
 What I show there, I mean I had to work Solvency II into an asset management presentation somehow, so I've done it. Those are just some of the regulatory initiatives that M&amp;G and the industry have had to either implement or start thinking about since the end of 2009. That regulatory environment does bring additional cost, it does add to the complexity of the business.
 Finally, asset management is a business that is fundamentally about people. We are a people business. We rely on people to deliver performance, we rely on people to distribute, we rely on people to provide the infrastructure and the support environment for our investment professionals. And given the growth in the business it's no surprise that we have seen a consequential increase in the headcount of M&amp;G.
 So in 2015 M&amp;G is a significantly bigger business than what it was in 2009. More clients, more assets under management, more revenues, but also greater cost. Despite that growth and despite everything that I said M&amp;G has actually managed to manage its cost base pretty sensibly during that time frame.
 I'm very thankful to Guy for him not embarrassing me in terms of showing what the industry averages from a cost income ratio or operating margin are. But you can see that M&amp;G's 58% cost income ratio as at the end of 2014 is incredibly competitive when compared to a number of our asset management rivals.
 What you've heard from Michael, however, in terms of what we've experienced a 2015 there is no doubt that there is upward pressure on that ratio. That pressure comes at a time when M&amp;G needs to continue investing in systems, technologies to cater for a business that is greater, more complicated and to cater for a business which is more geographically diverse than ever before.
 I think what we need to do is a business is guarded against taking any short-term decisions or short-term actions which could potentially or temporarily increase that cost income ratio but might ultimately cut into the muscle of the organization and have a negative impact on our long-term prospects. That's not to say that we aren't focused on costs, absolutely we are. It's just that any cost-saving initiatives that we consider need to be balanced and sensible and certainly taken with a long- to medium-term view insight.
 So as I said, very brief for myself. I'm going to head back to Michael now just to wrap up and make some concluding comments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, thank you Grant. Just a couple of slides here to pull it together.
 Looking forward, at a macro aggregate level you have to be optimistic about the asset management industry for the reasons I've already outlined: the need for aging populations to save, the appetite to save in unwrapped simple savings vehicles. Stand up anyone who would disagree with that. And at M&amp;G I hope you've been convinced over the years that we are an innovative business with a good track record in delivering new product and a proven ability to convert new ideas into material fund flows.
 At this point I stand up and I'm not quite sure whether I pour a bucket of ice cold water over me or I chuck it all over you. But I am by nature quite cautious and I am quite cautious about the asset management industry in the UK. And rather than give you the (expletive) version this is what I think.
 Why am I cautious? Well, you all know we've had two years of virtually zero returns from markets. So the average saver has been getting fund reports from us or from his or her IFA basically saying returns are plus or minus naught.
 That's not a very helpful backdrop when you've got fund management businesses charging, proposing to charge anything between 75 and north of 200 basis points. It produces an atmosphere of downward pressure on fees which I do not think is going to go away.
 We've got the rise of the passive houses well documented. And it's not just BlackRock, of course, it's Vanguard which is a fabulous business owned by its own funds. There is no shareholder, it's a sort of monster and it's at-large in Europe as well as in America.
 And I have nothing bad to say about Vanguard because they are an important client of ours. We manage some of their funds and they are a super bunch of people. But it is a very, very dangerous beast in the jungle.
 There is a lot of competition in the industry. There is pricing, there are downward pricing initiatives being taken by competitors all the time at the moment. And I think that the aftershocks of RDR, in particular, are being felt and will continue to be felt for some years to come.
 With the clients having to sign checks they ask questions of the advisor and the advisor in turn is looking to find ways of engineering cost out of the whole value chain so that the ultimate cost to the client can be reduced. And, of course, resorting to applying pressure on the active fund managers, using passives as much as possible are obvious routes to take and I don't think that this is going to stop, quite frankly. And we've got MiFID II coming up in Europe which will have some similar effects in Europe.
 And then if that wasn't all enough, we've got the FCA's asset management competition market study which has been unleashed. It was announced in November last year and that's in full swing or the evidence gathering is in full swing at the moment. And that's going to be interesting.
 Now Brexit is an extra nasty little factor we've got in there. It's not something that's impossible to deal with but it adds considerably to uncertainty. And there will be costs in adapting to it if the UK does vote to come out.
 Obviously, we are on a fast-track now to knowing what the outcome of the referendum is going to be. But it would certainly have cost for us, although we have a plan as to how we would deal with it.
 We are -- are we uniquely vulnerable? No. I wouldn't say we are uniquely vulnerable.
 We are certainly exposed because you will be aware that we sell a UK domiciled fund range, the OEIC, into Europe. We do not operate in Europe off of SICAV and, therefore, if the UK was going to come out of Europe we would have to be able to have a SICAV range to be able to take all the European investors.
 And, finally, there is increased scrutiny of the asset management industry. It's absolutely in the spotlight. The regulators feel that they've done their stuff with the banking sector and they have swung the spotlight over to the asset management industry and I don't think that's going to go away either.
 So at a macro level, of course, it's a growing market but there are challenges here. I am by nature quite cautious and I'm being cautious.
 And that's it for me. I think we are going to move on to questions in a few minutes.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so we are ready for Q&amp;A on the UK. We go Jon and then Greig.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Could I ask two questions please? First, on the UK life business, Prudential Financial Planning, to what extent is that addressing the traditional custom demographic of the Pru? And if it isn't do you have a sufficiently broad product range to compete with the other vertically integrated firms is the first question?
 And then secondly just a follow-up with Michael on Brexit, is the issue principally moving the funds into a new SICAV wrapper? Or are there other things in terms of having local manufacturing in Europe, as well? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Warburton,  Prudential plc - Executive Director, Distribution, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I will pick the first one on PFP. So when we first established PFP it was very much focused on meeting the needs of the existing Prudential customer base. And we actually took the top 10% of the traditional customer base that hadn't been introduced by intermediaries, very similar profile actually to the intermediary book of business.
 PFP does have a full suite of products to meet the full range of financial planning needs and they are serving that need to our existing customer. Increasingly what we're doing as the business matures is bringing in new lead sources, so new franchise. You may see on Aki's slide the 80% of the business we wrote in the first nine months of last year was from existing customers and 20% was from new customers introduced into that franchise.
 That's part of our strategy. We will continue to build that out. We will continue to build new franchises, as well, and our partners, that's how we refer to our advisors, have the full range of financial solutions to meet those needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So to Jon's questions, the plan at the moment, Jon, is that we would migrate the funds to actually to Ireland where we would have an Irish equivalent of a SICAV and we would keep the asset management outside Europe in the UK. But you raise a very interesting point because there is a question there as to whether the UK would be able to negotiate the continuing arrangements where non-European asset managers manage European assets. So there is a more fundamental issue which we don't know the answer to at the moment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hello, Greig Paterson, KBW. Just three quick questions. One is I was just interested in the comment about the PRA, EIOPA view on the ability to recalculate transitionals. I wonder if you can just give us some color on how that would work? That's question one.
 The second question is the FCA. I notice when I came back for the New Year is reviewing whether they will reintroduce commission into the IFA market. I wonder how one would think about your strategy in that context?
 And the third thing is in terms of M&amp;G and the product suite and funds outflows, if you want to talk about the fact that you don't have a strong proposition in the GARs space and that maybe is the reason your Achilles' heel in the business model? Or am I wrong?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aki Hussain,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'll take the question on the transitional recalculation. I guess what I was making reference to there is the both the PRA and Aki Hussain it's within the rules as well have our position statement which is that transitional deductions will be recalculated if there are significant changes to the risk profile.
 And one of the drivers of that is the interest rate changes. The detail of that has yet to be worked out and we are working very closely with the PRA as to exactly what that means. But for our business it means that both the risk margin and the transitional effectively move in tandem.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Warburton,  Prudential plc - Executive Director, Distribution, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I will pick up the commission question. So the reference to commission really was off the back of the pharma review. So this is the review into why I mean access to advice in the market.
 One of the primary barriers to consumers, mass-market consumers in particular taking advice or the perceived barrier is paying the cost for advice and, therefore, there is a view that by reintroducing commission it either lowers or removes that barrier. I think the challenge in terms of that model will be unless we can change the economics of that model I don't see in the reintroduction of commission fundamentally changing the provision advice.
 A lot of providers and a lot of businesses withdrew the services to the mass-market well before the retail distribution review, well before the banning of commission. So I think the ability of companies to be able to pay for the cost of distribution services could change it but only to the extent that the economics have provided that change, as well. And that really means a change in the regulatory environment around that service provision.
 So I think the debate of reintroduction of commission isn't reintroducing it for the traditional advice model through intermediaries. It's in the context of is there an alternative way that distributing product that sits outside of the current envelope of regulations. And if there is, is there remuneration for that through a commission type model?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I would agree with what John says. The heart slightly sinks at the fact that we may have to suddenly retrace steps and have some fund ranges that pay commission and some that don't and the margins have all contracted because of all the factors I've talked about and how would those margins than accommodate commission. It wasn't rocket science to be able to see that there was going to be a portion of the savings chain that was going to be left without advice.
 We don't, it's a statement of belief and hope here but I would personally hope that there was some other way of solving that problem than throwing a whole load more change back at the industry. But obviously it has to be possible.
 On the question of GARs, Greig, optimal income has been our GARs. Optimal income has I think or did outgrow an outsized GARs. Not that it's a game of growth or size but that's what it did.
 It's not the same and we are looking at this space anyway. You won't find us coming up with a copycat GARs product. But we're always looking at new ideas that we think makes sense for savers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, thanks. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. So the UK strategy seems to depend quite a lot on the PruFund, so is the PruFund not available through other platforms, so you don't have to buy drawdown or anything from you guys, you can get it I thought it was the expansion.
 The second question is clearly the PruFund has done phenomenally well but it does have gap risk because you only smooth up to 10% above asset shares. So somebody could buy the PruFund and tomorrow lose 10% of their assets and so how does an advisor risk categorize this?
 Presumably they put all their assets in PruFund or do they use PruFund for a small proportion of their assets and put it in other things and how do you capture that? Do you sell PruFund with other M&amp;G funds or is it just people just put 100% in one of the PruFund versions? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Warburton,  Prudential plc - Executive Director, Distribution, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I will pick that up. So different intermediaries use it use it in different ways. So some intermediaries obviously use modern portfolios and some intermediaries will use a core satellite that will have PruFund or one of the range of PruFunds at the core and then they'll choose other funds that sit around it as part of their model portfolio.
 One of the reasons why we introduce the risk managed range of PruFunds is most intermediaries do use risk modeling tools which are the proprietary tools that exist in the market. And they classically will have a grade of risk and return and the risk manage portfolio actually mapped against those risk and returns. So they can choose to use a single solution.
 I think what you have to remember is in that context PruFund or whichever PruFund you choose there is, I think Aki already alluded to, is a multi-asset fund that's actively managed and is effectively constantly rebalanced to stick against that risk spectrum. So a lot of intermediaries do use it as, if you like, something that they can put in place that meets that customer solution and they know it will continue to meet that risk return.
 You are right, the way that PruFund works and the reason why it does have such a strong appeal actually is we removed a lot of the smoke and mirrors associated with traditional with-profits. So as you know we do publish an expected growth rate, we increase the unit price in line with our expected growth rate and we have published corridors for smoothing. Which does mean that you will have seen in Aki's chart that a consumer is not completely isolated, but even in terms of market shocks, and you will have seen this in 2008 in particular, they are still sheltered from part of that market fall.
 If a customer really wants to protect their full capital, again, one of the options that's available is protection. So what the customer can do for an additional option price, effectively, is to take out protection which protects their original investment to level of 100% at their chosen time period. So an intermediary can use the range of PruFunds to map against both the customer's attitude to risk and reward but also capacity for loss, as well.
 I think the other part of the question that you asked was the availability of PruFund. At the moment, and it is a unique proposition for us and therefore it is very much a crown jewel from our point of view, you can only buy PruFund through a Prudential wrapper. We have built some of our tax wrappers, so we start with onshore bond onto third-party platforms.
 So you can buy our unit linked funds at the moment through our onshore bond through a number of third-party platforms in the marketplace. We built that as a bridgehead to actually create the infrastructure to be able to deploy our investment solutions on third-party platforms. One of the evolutions that we are looking at we will have to make considered choices about this is making PruFund available through those wrappers onto third-party platforms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gordon Aitken,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Gordon Aitken from RBC. A couple of questions please. First, on bulk annuities, you've mentioned your reduced appetite due to the introduction of the risk margin.
 Just wondering what happens in that market in the future, what's your views? And defined benefit schemes seem to be on at unstoppable journey of derisking. You've got GBP1.4 trillion of liabilities in that space.
 Do DB schemes have to pay more now? Do you think that Solvency II effectively slows the journey of derisking or do you think maybe the schemes go directly to reinsurers?
 And the second question on with-profits, obviously been super successful in the retail side. Can this now be sold to institutions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aki Hussain,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so I will take the question on bulks. In terms of market evolution, I mean my expectation would be that there will be a shift in pricing. I think it may well take a bit of time to come through.
 The market has to reflect the realities of the new Solvency regime. So that may well, and will likely, translate into a higher payment for effectively be insurance contract.
 In terms of going direct to reinsurers, reinsurers by and large don't have the origination capability or the infrastructure required. But ultimately what these schemes are looking for is to go to a partner who can in due course undertake a full buyout and the full administration and that's not a skill set that reinsurers have but we as a life Company do.
 So my expectation is pricing will shift. I think we just need to wait and see how far it will shift.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Warburton,  Prudential plc - Executive Director, Distribution, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think I will pick up the question on with profits and into the institutional market. I think the challenge there, and we're doing elements of it and I will explain what I mean by that. It's not pure institutional and the challenge is with-profits has to be available through an insurance wrapper and, therefore, it's the eligibility for an institutional investor to effectively buy an insurance product.
 The area that we make it available to what you would class as institutional investors really is through the trusted investment plan. So you will have seen during the course of the first nine months of last year that part of the driver is sort of our increases through our trusted investment plan.
 Quite a lot of corporates where they have got the appropriate structure and trustees do choose to invest in PruFund through the TIP, the trusted investment plan. It's not generally available on a wholesale basis is what you would generally regard as an institutional investment because it has to be available through an insurance wrapper.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barrie Cornes,  Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. - Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hello, it's Barrie Cornes from Panmure Gordon. A couple of questions for me. Certainly the first time medically underwritten bulks, I wonder if maybe that's a way forward for you and whether or not you would consider doing that. And also John, I think you mentioned it your presentation, you made a comment about non-core activities that might come along your way. I wonder if you mind expanding on that a little bit, please?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Foley,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I'm happy to go first with that one. It was a hedge-all statement because sitting in the audience at these events in the past what I realize is if you don't say something and then you go and do something new you get asked why you are doing that? Then it's non-core.
 So I throw up just the idea really that the Pru, I personally believe, is a powerhouse. We will see with this landscape is changing. The whole dynamics are moving.
 You are asking questions about bulks. We don't know the answers to these questions. I don't know what trustees will think and so on.
 Opportunities will arise. We will consider those opportunities outside of our core propositions if they make money for our shareholders, if it's good for our organization and if the customer impacts are positive. And that's really why I made that comment, it's nothing more than that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aki Hussain,  Prudential plc - CFO, Prudential UK &amp; Europe   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In terms of medically underwritten bulks I can refer you to John's answer. I mean it's not something that we do today, it's not core. If the opportunity emerges and it's valuable then we'll take a look at it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ming Zhu,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's Ming Zhu from Canaccord. Just one question on M&amp;G. At Q3 you've mentioned that weak retail outflow would continue into Q4. Could you please provide an update what you have seen year to date and when you actually think that outflow could stabilize going forward and what's the sort of trigger point on the outflow that will push up your 58% cost income ratio?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, can you repeat the last bit of that question?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ming Zhu,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What's the sort of trigger point in terms of the outflow that will actually start to bite into your cost income ratio?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael McLintock,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, M&amp;G Investments   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I'm afraid I can't answer the first part of your question because we can only go on publicly disclosed information and that's to the end of Q3. So I'm afraid that you've just got to wait for the Pru's full-year results on that.
 What might lead to a change, a reverse to this situation, I just come back to what I said to you during my presentation. You have got as much of an idea of this as I have and if that seems, I mean it's a very, very difficult to forecast. We didn't manage to forecast the moment when optimal income went into outflow, and I can't forecast when it will go back into inflow if it will.
 Maybe it won't but maybe the outflows slow down to a very low level and inflows come in from other funds. There can be all sorts of patterns and it totally depends on investment performance and the economic environment. And optimal income has particularly borne the brunt of changing views about interest rates, inflation and absolute returns and this has all come together into this melting pot and we're still in this melting pot.
 We all know it. What we're seeing going on at the moment and markets is all part of this yet to be fully resolved debate. And we've got to see that result before we know what the pattern of flows will be for optimal income and indeed what this combination of economic factors means for the sorts of factors that deliver investment performance on other funds.
 On the cost income ratio, Grant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Grant Speirs,  Prudential plc - Group Finance Director, M&amp;G Investments   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Michael, for that hospital pass. I could do like the South African cricket team and just drop it. That's one solution.
 Again, that's a difficult one and I think given its forward-looking nature it's something that I can't really comment on. I think when you see the results for 2015 we'll be producing that number.
 Again, as I said there's no secret to the asset management model. You've seen what outflows have been to the end of quarter three. In the Pru financials you can probably take a stab at what the margins to those are and you can probably take a stab at all that ourselves.
 Our cost base is not entirely flexible, unfortunately. So as I said in my presentation there is upward pressure but we will just manage sensibly.
 At what point will it flip from the 58? Well, I would just again reiterate what I said earlier. The 58 is incredibly competitive.
 Unsustainably so, perhaps. We've enjoyed a fantastic run. We should, and I think we've been flagging this in previous seminars or in previous investor days, it is likely to go up at some stage.

Presentation

 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shall we begin -- or end, I should say? You've all demonstrated extraordinary patience today waiting for the headline act to finally appear on stage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When is he arriving?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, yes. Thank you. Chad will be on in about 15 or 20 minutes. He is -- you're right. Chad, of all the presenters that we have for you here today, of course Chad is the one that always has people in stitches, so I'll try to be brief and we'll look forward to that. There's nothing funnier than hedging, yes.
 Okay. Here we go. This slide -- Mike touched on some of these messages; I think Mike was at the point this morning of starting to read you the names of the retiring Baby Boomers. But we've talked about Baby Boomers at length for as long as I've been at Prudential, which is about 10 years now.
 So this is a familiar story; I won't dwell on it. But I'll simply remind you that defined benefits, employer-sponsored defined benefit plans as we knew them, are essentially a thing of the past.
 The government still does offer defined-benefit pensions to employees. Of course, they are colossally underfunded. So that will be interesting when the day of reckoning comes with that.
 And Social Security in the United States, which was -- the genesis of it was to provide a basic level of subsistence income to the poorest of the poor in the United States. People have gotten themselves in a position where they rely upon it to do something it was never intended to do and does not do.
 So, this is -- there's really two points to this slide. The first is that the consumers who are already under-saved, who've not saved sufficiently for retirement, don't have the resources to supplement Social Security, are going to live a lot longer than they thought.
 I think it was -- those of you who are familiar with American music, it was I think Eubie Blake who was a famous ragtime composer and performer, morphed into jazz, died in I think 1983 at the age of 96; I think it was his 79th birthday when he coined the phrase -- it's often used: If I'd known I was going to live this long, I would have taken much better care of myself.
 We could paraphrase him and say that if we had known that we were going to live this long, this entire generation of Baby Boomers, we might have behaved differently when it came to savings. But we didn't, and here we are.
 That situation is exacerbated by the fact that in a low interest rate environment, as we are today, the typical consumer, the typical investor -- not necessarily the more sophisticated investor, but the typical middle-class American Baby Boomer, who has under-saved, again is going to live too long, is not very good at getting good returns on his money. He tends to be conservative; he tends to buy -- to the extent that he gets in the equity markets, he does it at the wrong time: he buys high, he sells low.
 It's the classic story. So an unfortunate convergence of events.
 So measure the gap. Try to calculate the problem. If we look at these different cohorts of Baby Boomers, if you look at these that we've circled in the middle -- those from 45 to 64 -- the average, the median household income for those households is about $60,000. Now, a good rule of thumb is that experts say you need to be able to generate in retirement about 70% of your working life income; so that becomes $42,000.
 Now, $24,000 of that -- 40% of that in this case -- about $24,000 of that income will be produced by Social Security. So the gap for this very average American family is about $18,000 a year.
 But again, in a low interest rate environment, it's difficult to grow savings, to catch up, make your pension pot -- if you will, as it's called in the UK -- make your pension pot bigger. That's very difficult. And the interest rates we're seeing today, you can't just invest the money at interest and expect the interest to really do anything to solve your problem.
 So what retirees really need are access to growth that over the last several years -- and I would argue in the coming years -- they're really only going to get by exposure to the equity market. They need to protect their principal. Because they are under-saved, because of the situation they're in, they really have no margin for error.
 They need a mechanism to convert what savings they have into retirement income. And most of all, they need certainty.
 So that's where we come in. And it's a little frustrating to be in a situation where we have a product that has enormous social utility, that solves a real problem, a real need in society today, and it's under attack. And we'll come back and talk about the Department of Labor in a moment.
 But the reality is, what Jackson does is important. It really matters. It makes a difference.
 Variable annuities provide guaranteed income and access to market growth. So for consumers who are under-saved, it allows them to continue to accumulate whilst having the prospect of getting a guaranteed income for the rest of their life.
 Annuities are the only way -- in the North American market it's the only way to get access to a guaranteed income for life. It is effectively a defined benefit pension plan for the 21st century, the principal difference being that the annuity products are funded whereas the defined benefit plans we knew and loved in the past were underfunded, which is why they're dinosaurs now.
 Jackson's approach to annuities is unique in several ways, several important ways, I think. First of all, when you buy a guarantee, a living benefit from Jackson, we're the only company in the market today that offers you full investment freedom.
 If you buy for most of our competitors and you want a guaranteed withdrawal benefit for life, what they're going to say is: That's great, but your investment options just went from here to here. So what they've effectively done is you've paid a fee for a guarantee, and what they've done effectively is make that fee a lot more expensive because they have dramatically limited your ability to continue to accumulate, to get equity growth while you're de-cumulating. So that's an extremely important distinction and it's one of the reasons I think Jackson continues to be the market leader.
 Open architecture product design. There's enormous flexibility built into our product. You know our approach: we are very advisor centric; we are strongly convicted that advice is one of the most important ingredients in a sensible retirement plan; and we've always been very supportive of those who give good advice, the financial advisors that we work with across the country.
 This allows, effectively, the advisor to craft for a middle-class American -- and this will sound odd -- but a mass-produced customized solution. There's enough flexibility and yet we have manufactured it on a platform that's so efficient that it allows us to deliver it at a sensible cost.
 We have best-in-class customer service and we provide it at an incredibly low cost relative to the marketplace. Now, Andy was just fussing at me about our 30-odd basis points; but the reality is the average cost in the annuity space in the United States is over 60 basis points. We're half the average, and there are credible, recognizable providers whose fees are 3 times ours, whose costs are 3 times ours. So award-winning best-in-class service at a very competitive price.
 Financial stability. Chad will give you the latest update, but you've seen our performance pre-crisis, through the cycle. The reality is we are very financially sound, a very strong operator. Promises made have consistently been promises kept, and that speaks to the certainty, the financial strength and the certainty that investors need.
 And we have an unparalleled track record of execution and delivery through the cycle, and that's an important distinction as well.
 Now this is a representation, I guess you could say, of the commercial dimension of our success. This also, I think, in some ways supports the story of credibility and certainty of Jackson.
 Pick a metric: we've performed well across the board really, by virtually any imaginable metric on those first three, which are really financial metrics.
 And the fourth, Elite Access, that really speaks to the creativity of the team, the ability to craft a product, introduce it, build the story around that product, the need that it meets, and be able to utterly dominate the market in that particular segment of investment-only VAs. We dominate the annuities market in general, but within investment-only we utterly dominate.
 I think this is the third time you've probably seen a slide like this today, if my mental record-keeping is accurate. The story here -- you saw it: Mike showed you one in the context of the Group; Tony showed you one of the context of Asia.
 The track record of success that we showed you on the previous slide was not accomplished in a benign environment. It's a complicated world that we operate in. This, the fact that we've been able to do what we do speaks to discipline.
 One of the principal examples of discipline you see here is the flattening out of our sales immediately before the crisis when, in our view, the market was losing its head and guarantees were being written that -- we didn't like the way they were written and we didn't like the price at which they were written. And we gave up considerable market share to ride out that; and I think that's proven to be one of the smartest things we ever did. It has -- I think it's one of the reasons, again, we're in the leadership position that we're in today.
 I got a lot of questions on this last night. Mike's touched on this already. I want to talk about it from two perspectives.
 First, the politics of this, which is really the pivotal thing right now. I think you've all watched fairly closely the progression of this proposed rule change as it's worked its way through the system. We're now in a silent period, so it's impossible to say exactly what's going on, because no one will really disclose what the discussions are.
 What the industry was able to do in the late summer and early fall was something that it's rarely able to do, and that is: unite, with a reasonable level of effectiveness, and convince a vast majority of members of Congress and members of the U.S. Senate that this is a really bad idea. Primarily because it affects qualified money; that's really people with IRAs and 401(k)s. Principally 401(k) monies is effectively what it will target. These are middle-class Americans.
 And what it's going to do by changing the way in which advice is paid for, for people with relatively small accounts it will dramatically reduce their availability of advice to those individuals. It's likely to limit product options. And importantly, it increases costs when the whole stated objective of this was to ensure that costs are lower.
 So people talk about a 7% upfront commission as being an egregious cost to be built into a product. For a product that you hold for 10 years, 15 years, 7% -- and you guys are smarter than I am, so I'll give you a moment to do the math -- but 7% up front is less than 1.5% a year for 15 or 20 years.
 The financial implications of this for middle-class Americans are not good. These are the people that need advice the most; they are the most under-saved; they require this solution more than anyone else. And it will be less available to them than it will be to other segments of the marketplace.
 So it is an unfortunate turn of events. We have seen what happens in other markets where regulators come in and have issues with the way products are sold and make massive sweeping changes to compensation. What you've ultimately seen in every market is penetration rates drop. That is likely to happen here in this sector of the marketplace.
 Good news is, there is widespread bipartisan support for stopping this somehow, someway. The hope is that when the final rule is published, which is probably April or May, we think -- we don't know, but that's what we hear -- that there will have been some modifications that will make it palatable. There's no doubt that there will be changes; but hopefully that the new rule is palatable and manageable and doesn't have the effect on middle-class Americans that we fear it might have.
 In the event that we end up with what you could call the worst-case scenario, if you will, an undiluted version of the rule change, there's already been legislation filed -- and I think politically this was done to send a strong signal to the White House that there is serious opposition. So there's a bill has been filed in the House, where all legislation starts, and it's got broad bipartisan support.
 It allegedly has 70 votes in support of it in the Senate. It would unwind the rule change and basically cause them to go back and start over and reevaluate.
 The hope is that with the prospect of a near-certain veto or overriding a veto -- because the President has said that any legislation that passes that attempts to undo this that he will veto. With 70 votes in the Senate, the math works: you'll get an override of that veto.
 The hope is that that will bring everyone to the table in a spirit of compromise and we can come up with something more sensible. But we'll see. We'll end up with some version of this rule change.
 So that's the political dimension of what has happened and is happening and may happen. The other thing to think about here, though -- and Mike touched on this this morning, and it really is the most important point -- and that's the opportunity that this presents. I don't want to diminish the disruption that this rule change in whatever form it occurs will create. But this team has a track record of responding positively and creatively and innovatively to disruption.
 You have seen it happen before. You've see what we've done with Elite Access. I think that's just the most recent example.
 I can tell you that there is already an enormous amount of work underway to craft both the product solutions and the technology solutions that will be required to deal with this in whatever form it comes out. So you should expect us to innovate, and you should expect us to turn any disruption like this to our commercial advantage. Based upon our track record, that's what you should expect us to do, and that's what we have every intention of doing.
 Now, again, we have talked to you on and on and on over the years about the Baby Boomers. And the reason is because it's -- as much as I have stood before you over the last decade and talked about this historic thing that is happening in Asia, Mike and Clark before him have stood before you and talk about the Baby Boomers, because in fact it is of equal historic significance as what's happening in Asia.
 It's different in terms of the duration of the opportunity. It's more finite, because there's a point at which all the Baby Boomers will have retired.
 But as you can see here the people that turned 65 in 2015, born in 1950, were still at the very beginning of the Baby Boom. The real money is ahead of us. In terms of number of retirees and the amount they have, the real money is still ahead of us.
 So this opportunity has a long way to run. There's no doubt about that.
 Having said that, it's not forever. Nothing is forever. So one of the things that we have to think about within Jackson is: What's the next big thing?
 In our view, the next big thing is the Millennials. They have now surpassed the Baby Boomers in terms of absolute numbers. The earliest Millennials are now in their early 30s, mid-30s.
 There's enough credible data about their economic behavior that we can start to draw some conclusions about how they will be different than we are, than the Baby Boomers are. And there, I think, will be some significant differences.
 They ultimately will have the same need that the Baby Boomers have. They will have a lot of money -- I think they are destined to surpass the Baby Boomers as the wealthiest generation in history. I think you can almost take that as a given. So they will have many of the same fundamental needs, but our view is that they will approach them differently.
 So the one thing we can do -- if you start blue-skying about: What could we do to serve the needs of Millennials? First thing we could do is keep them from getting into a situation where the Baby Boomers are, where they are under-saved, so there is an accumulation play with Millennials before the de-cumulation play.
 The other thing that's clear about Millennials, in my view, is that they are going to interact differently. Everybody needs advice; but how you provide that advice, deliver that advice, will undoubtedly be different.
 We all know the inclination -- if you sit in a restaurant full of 20- and 30-year-old people, they are texting across the table as opposed to talking. They're very comfortable with the electronics.
 So I'm not suggesting that roboadvisor is the way of the future in an undiluted form. I do still believe there has to be provision of advice. But more enabling of advice via technology is, I think, destined to be part of the future.
 There's a variety of different ways in which you look at the spending habits of the Millennials and they are different. Their needs and wants and desires are different. The things that are important to them are different. The homes they are buying, the way they are furnishing those homes -- there's an enormous amount of data that's emerging on how this generation will spend differently, will behave differently in terms of economics.
 We have -- we're doing work within Jackson to prepare for the next big thing. The work that was done to turn Jackson into the best-in-class variable annuity shop in North America began in the 1980s. The work that is necessary to ensure that we maintain that position through this generational change has to begin today, and it already has begun.
 So the thing I would leave you with now before I turn it over to Chad is that, while you're going to continue to hear a lot about Baby Boomers in the coming years, you'll hear more and more and more about new and different and innovative things that we're going to address the needs of the next generation as those needs emerge. And now I will turn it over to Chad, who will take you through the numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Barry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for sticking around for the last session or the next-to-last session here. Good news is Raghu cut me back from the 100 slides that I was going to do, so we should be able to get out of here before 7:00.
 Just a couple broad themes I want to hit on today. Just thinking about -- I'm going to take a more granular look at sales trends. We've talked about sales; sales have been capped for a while; hasn't been a real exciting story.
 But there are some things we've been doing underneath the bonnet, I think you guys say over here, that we've been doing. It might be, I think, interesting to see.
 I'm going to give you a little more context on DOL as a little bit of follow-up on the financial side to what Barry talked about. Wouldn't be a US presentation without talking a little bit about the guarantee book, so I'll spend a few minutes on that. And then we've had an understandable interest in the credit book, so for the first time in many, many years we'll talk about the credit book a little bit.
 Starting off with this slide, sales as I mentioned have continue to be managed to plan. We've been capped on the guarantee side of it, and then we've also had headwinds in other parts of the business. If you think about fixed annuities, indexed annuities, it's been a long time since we've had a reasonable market to be able to sell those in, mostly due to the fact that interest rates have been so low; so we continue to see a very modest amount of sales in the indexed and the fixed annuity side of it.
 With spreads having widened out, though, we're seeing a little bit of opportunity on the institutional side, the GIC-MTN portion of the business. We're in a good part of the credit cycle for that, where investors are still looking for up-and-quality type of names, but the rest of the credit universe is widening out. That's a good time for that kind of spread arbitrage type of business, so we're seeing a little bit more of that.
 Elite Access you can see is basically flat on a year-to-date basis. What we're seeing there is headwinds from the broker-dealer space. We've seen a number of broker-dealers actually restrict Elite Access within qualified accounts -- thematically, DOL type of stuff as well.
 But they've restricted those there, and what you're seeing effectively is a pause in the growth of VA as most of the business moves from a qualified to a nonqualified basis. We are north of 70% now on the nonqual side for Elite Access.
 As I mentioned, the guarantee portion has been relatively steady as a percentage of overall sales for the last several years, and I'll get onto some more of that in a moment here. But I think overall too, you can see sales are down a little bit year-over-year.
 Part of that is due to the fact that we were coming off of a sales slowdown in late 2014, so we had a slow start to 2015. So you're annualizing out something that's below average.
 But we actually have seen a little bit of a pause, I think, in the market as broker-dealers and reps have waited to see what's going to come through on DOL. In particular, with the original proposal there was no concept of grandfathering; so you could end up with your entire back book as an investment advisor all of a sudden coming under a fiduciary rule. And of course, why would you want to add to that backlog if you didn't have certainty on the grandfathering?
 DOL seems to be constructive on the grandfather. We don't expect that will be a problem; but it just technically wasn't included, which I think again left a little bit of headwind to the market.
 If I look at this next slide here, this is just looking at the guarantee book excluding Elite Access. This is the core perspective to type of product.
 You can see we've been managing this over the last several years to about a $4.5 billion per quarter run rate. Lots of ups and downs there; in certain periods we've basically withdrawn from the market to stay within those limits. But again, running about $4.5 billion.
 In order to keep it at that level -- again, just for context -- over this period of time we have withdrawn some of our more high-intensity guarantees from the marketplace. Those have gone and haven't come back.
 We've increased fees. We've cut commissions to the rep. And again, when that wasn't enough we've actually withdrawn from the market. Like you'll see that low point there in fourth-quarter 2014, and you would have seen us actually pulling out of the market for several weeks just to tampen down sales and keep the annual plan in check.
 We continue to see this bubbling up of demand in excess of our ability to provide it. So what's that's left us with is Elite Access really is the growth engine and, as Barry mentioned, that's done quite well for us.
 But I would say just as a general takeaway from this slide is that with DOL coming we do find ourselves still constraining sales at this level. If DOL were to actually put a dent in the market, even if it's a temporary dent, we should actually have the ability to relax some of these governors and take some of that back up to offset some of that. So I think we're in a decent position with respect to that.
 We've talked about the Elite Access story for a couple years now. That's been our primary focus in terms of de-risking the portfolio, in terms of through new sales. Again, that's more of the headline.
 What hasn't been quite as clear that I want to draw out a little bit more today is that we've also been derisking the VA within the traditional VA guarantee. I mentioned we removed certain of the more high-intensity guarantees as we've been managing sales down; and we've also done some other things that have been, again, somewhat innovative in the market.
 If you go back to Q4 of 2012, we actually -- the traditional guarantee in the US market for a GMWB has been a 5% withdrawal rate at age 65; it's kind of the standard. So what we did back then was we introduced a lower-cost, lower-guarantee product. There was some suspicion as to whether that was going to catch on or not, because the higher the guarantee tends to be, the higher the demand in the market.
 But nonetheless, we actually saw a pretty good take-up rate in that on launch, and we saw that build through 2013 and 2014, which set us up to then go ahead and launch another series of even lower-cost, even lower-guarantee products in 2015. So we still offer the traditional 5% at 65, but we now have guarantees that go down to as low as 4%.
 If you think about just the level of guarantee risk, 2011 would've been the first year that we were limiting sales. If you think about just what that sales mix looks like since then, we've seen nominal sales grow -- in the red bars -- but the actual risk intensity of the sales overall has actually decreased a fair bit. You can see that; the blue line there gives you an idea of what the risk-weighted sales. This is just a measure of effectively guarantee intensity that we look at internally.
 But having brought that down we're actually seeing less risk on the new sales, even though nominal sales is going up. So I think it's a good story there from a risk perspective.
 A couple slides we'll talk about on, again, the financial backdrop to DOL. As I mentioned, we've been limiting VA sales over the last several years due to the -- there's a lot of excess demand out there; we just haven't been willing to fill that amount of demand. But even despite the fact we've been level for several years, we're still seeing very positive net flows coming through into the VA.
 In fact if you look, the third bullet down there shows that year-to-date surrenders and benefits or outflows have only been about 42% of premium. So again, a very, very strong story there year-to-date.
 What that basically means is -- and again, this is not a prediction; it's just a point I'm making -- is that if you saw the qualified business go away altogether due to DOL, we would still be in a slight positive net flow position. So very, very strong positioning from that perspective.
 If you contrast that to the industry, the rest of the industry ex-Jackson through three quarters saw about $17 billion in negative outflows. So if you think about coming into a DOL situation where you might have a dent in the qualified side of your business and you're in a very significant net outflow position, you're just really piling on a bad situation. From our perspective, we're coming at it from a position of strength, clearly facing a different set of problems than the rest of the industry is.
 Looking at it through a different lens, again if you were to look here, if you just said we're going to eliminate all VA sales -- again a very extreme scenario, and even beyond DOL -- this just looks at the profitability of our in-force book. We continue to see a very consistent amount of high-level profitability, high-level free surplus being generated. So even several years to come in the future we would still see a very, very robust and very consistent level of free surplus generated, even if we didn't add anything to the new VA.
 So again, we're not expecting dislocation. In fact, as Barry mentioned, we actually think there could be some opportunity for us in here.
 There are parts of the market that just haven't sold VA traditionally that are going to be in the sweet spot of where DOL is going to be pushing things, and it'd be a good challenge for us to go out there and see if we can drive some business into that market. But overall, we feel like we're very well positioned to weather the storm come what may under the DOL.
 Moving on to the in-force book, this slide to be familiar to most of you. I've used for several times over the last couple years. We used to refer to this as Mike's favorite slide; I'm sure it still is.
 We haven't actually polled Barry yet to see if it's his favorite slide, but it may soon become.

 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I love it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so Barry loves it. All right, two out of two can't be wrong.
 The analysis here is focusing on the 9/30 book, which coincidentally -- if you look at the upper left-hand corner, this is S&amp;P at 1,920, which is about where it is today, so this is a relatively fresh look at the book relative to this, again, even though we're four months out of date.
 Just as a refresher, this analysis is expected cash flows on the guarantee book only. It ignores previously collected fees, any reserves we might have up against the book currently, and ignores hedging altogether.
 Just walking through those real quick, upper left-hand corner, again this is the base scenario: 5% gross return; no big surprise. Even though we're a little bit in the money at this point in time at 9/30, you see PV of fees way outweighs PV of benefits, to the tune of about $7 billion. So very, very healthy back book at 9/30 in a normal environment.
 If you look at the bottom left you'll see it's a 100 basis point rate shock there, rate shock down. That's not impacting the underlying subaccounts; so you're not getting -- really the only impact to interest rates there is the discounting. The discounting impact is about the same on both, so really no net impact.
 The more interesting one is the bottom right, which is the down 40% instantaneous shock. What we'll see there is, because the fees are benefit based and we're going to get better persistency in the down rate or down equity scenario, fees do go up. So we're seeing a small increase in fees there, call it 8% to 10% increase in fees. But obviously the benefits overwhelm that and you get to a net negative position there.
 This is -- in the years when I've shown this in the past, because we've been in more of a bull market around it we've tended to be more or less at near all-time highs most of the time along the way. So this is the first graph in while we will have seen that had the block with any meaningful money-ness to it.
 What you'll see is there is a negative $2.4 billion down there in terms of the fees relative to benefits. Again, that would be, I think, consistent with some of the negatives we've seen on prior in-the-money periods.
 But to put that into context, at 9/30 that $2.4 billion was about the same amount of reserves we had up on a statutory basis. I mentioned this doesn't include reserves; so now I'm just layering that in on top.
 Similarly, as I mentioned this excludes hedging, so if you were to put the hedging aspects in there, if you just look at the 9/30 existing hedge book, not assuming anything going forward, looked at a 40% shock down, that would be worth in excess of $13 billion worth of gains. So very, very well positioned there.
 And again, although the market is showing some signs of stress -- it's not been a fun start to the year I think for a lot of people -- we're still very, very happy with the profitability and positioning of our in-force book. And the effectiveness of the hedging continues to be very robust.
 Just in the -- as we seem to be kicking off a potentially more volatile period -- it certainly seemed to be starting last year and carried into this year -- I just thought I'd throw this in there just for a little bit of context. As we think about how our accounting and the underlying assumptions of the accounting versus historical, I just thought it would be worth level-setting that again; we haven't talked about it in a while.
 If you think about the green lines and the green bars, that's the S&amp;P on a historical basis; and the bars in there are basically the 25th percentile on the lower end and the 75th percentile on the higher end. So focusing on the 20-year portion of it, and these returns will probably be somewhat familiar to you. But on a geometric return basis, the 20-year S&amp;P return would be mid-9%s; the lower 25th percentile would be around a 7% type of return; the upper 75th or the upper quartile would be at around an 11% type of return. So that's the range of historical that we've seen within a pretty wide confidence interval.
 If you go to the next line down, the orange one, that's EEV. So EEV is compounding at about a 5% rate, which should consistent with the assumptions that we have set under EEV.
 The next one down, the blue line, that's statutory. And statutory, here you're looking at -- it's a tail measure, so you're looking at the basically the worst 10% of something that looks like historical results. That equates to about a 2% per year geometric type of return, which is roughly consistent with the worst ever 20-year period we've seen in the S&amp;P.
 Then finally, IFRS down at the bottom. IFRS, of course, is a market-consistent or risk-neutral type of approach. With rates as low as they are you get a very low return coming off of that, barely positive over that 20-year period of time.
 Keep in mind that that particular measure -- that's not a tail measure. That's the central; think about that as a central path, so half of it's below, half of it's above type of concept. So the IFRS is actually stated on a very conservative basis.
 Again, just as we start to see reserves that are going to start moving around and, again, the book is larger than it's ever been, if we get volatility reserves will start moving around. And it will be, I think, useful context to have to think about as we see those reserves moving around.
 Okay, so on to credit. As I mentioned, it's been a long time since anybody has actually wanted to talk about this. Our folks over at PPMA are actually starting to get a little bit of a complex because nobody wants to talk to them, but I think their time is coming. It will be well earned.
 Clearly the best part of the credit cycle is behind us at this point in time. Spreads have been widening for a while. We're definitely seeing some stress in the market.
 I think importantly from our perspective is, as we saw spreads tighten, as we saw risk-adjusted returns come in, we have not been chasing yield. You've seen, I think anecdotally, some folks have, some folks haven't.
 We have not been chasing yield. In fact, as we've seen risk-adjusted returns really compress over the 2013, 2014, and maybe in the first half of 2015 range, we've actually been trading more and more up in quality.
 If I just walk around that pie chart of our $60 billion portfolio, public investment-grade corporates at half the book is actually, I think, probably near our high levels that we've seen at least over the last 10 years. So it's a relatively -- obviously the largest portion of our book.
 Generally speaking, about half and half BBB, single-A, which is roughly in line with the index. So with that larger portfolio you might expect to be somewhere along the lines of the index, and that's where that is. Generally speaking, position sizes have come down over the years, so we're not as exposed to any one credit within that.
 If I move down to high-yield, high-yield is sub-3% now. Just for comparison purposes coming into the last credit cycle, 2007, 2008, we were at about 5% high-yield, so a fairly reduced position there. Within the high-yield universe, about north of 70% of the high-yield is actually in BB; so even though it's only 3% it's still actually an up in quality portfolio within that.
 Moving across to RMBS, which was the feature last time around, that's about 3% of the book, half of which is agency or government guaranteed paper. Within that, if you compare that to where we were coming into the last cycle, it was about 13%, of which only about a third of that was government guaranteed.
 CMBS, just under 6%. That's virtually all super-senior AAA, so very high credit worthy or a very high credit worthiness within that.
 Commercial mortgage loans at about 10%. We've had a very strong history within the CMLs. Again, small size; not a lot of concentration; well geographically diversified and diversified by property type.
 We've seen with that currently loan-to-value ratio on average about 58%. So very well positioned; again, better positioned than it would've been coming into 2007. So we're relatively relaxed about that.
 Then I think the other -- probably the biggest indicator in terms of the derisking would be that reddish wedge, which is Treasuries, which is now about 9% of the portfolio, so that's been building over the last couple years. We're not typically, obviously, a Treasury investor given that we are running a spread book; but the risk-adjusted returns just have not been particularly attractive, so we've been moving somewhat into Treasuries as a tactical move.
 It's also in this particular market, which is not a terribly liquid market right now in the fixed income, it gives us a nice pool of liquidity as well, which I think is helpful if things start getting a little bit nasty. So again, we've derisked the portfolio. We're not going to be unaffected by the next credit cycle, but we're better positioned than we've been coming into previous cycles.
 I think we are better positioned this time than the industry, which has not always been the case since again we tend to be more spread-intensive than a lot of the industry. And I think we're cautiously optimistic in terms of outcome there.
 Looking at credit spreads, we've been seeing -- we saw the bottom of the credit cycle in mid-2014; been moving up steadily since then. Obviously, a big lift in the last half of 2015 and into early 2016.
 Within this, really a lot of this is a commodity story. We've seen energy, we've seen metals and mining specifically widening. In fact if you actually adjusted those charts for those two sectors, you'd actually see that spreads have only really widened about 20, 25 basis points on the investment-grade and maybe 100 on high-yield. So right now it's very localized in those two, but it is getting somewhat contagious to the rest of the market.
 But again, since energy, metals and mining are the two that are under stress, take a minute just to focus on that. Energy has become the second largest sector behind financial -- and just behind financial. A big part of that is just the energy boom that we've had over the last I guess coming up on six, seven, eight years. A lot of debt put in place to do a lot of CapEx to get these resources out of the ground; so we've seen a lot of debt build up on the back end of that.
 I think what's important to note within this, though, is that not everything in energy is going to be oil focused. So we've broken out this chart here just to look at higher sensitivity versus lower sensitivity.
 The two highest sensitivity are going to be exploration and production, and oilfield equipment and services. Those are the ones that are actually drilling the wells or looking to do new exploration, which basically ceases when prices drop 80% like they have.
 Focusing in on just those pieces, what you see there is it's about $2 billion within the portfolio. I can't remember if I mentioned we're actually a little bit underweight energy in aggregate versus the index. So the $2 billion in total; about 40% of that sits in A- or better; only $200 million of that is sitting in high-yield. Again, these are all as of 9/30.
 You can see on the graph the market price of the total energy portfolio was still above par, so that looks pretty good. If you look at the unrealized for the two higher-risk subsectors within that, it was a $64 million unrealized loss within that, of which about $54 million was sitting in the high-yield portion of the portfolio.
 So at 9/30, still relatively benign situation as it stood. Marks have gotten worse since then, but we've also done some selling in Q4 as well. So net-net we've actually derisked a little bit from what we see on this graph here.
 Moving over to metals and mining, likewise under pressure for similar reasons. It's a much smaller sector, which helps. We've excluded steel here, because that's just a different market than some of the other metals and mining.
 Once again here, we're looking at about 30% A- or better; about 10% of it being high-yield, just about $100 million. Total unrealized loss of about $80 million; and actually here, most of it's investment-grade, not the noninvestment-grade portion, which is only about $11 million. Again here is why we made some sales in Q4 to reduce risk and are in, I think, in good position relative to these.
 So overall we're fairly comfortable with the overall risk profile of the portfolio. We've taken action on some of the more stressed sectors and, again, over the last couple years have generally remained up in quality.
 So I think at this point it's mostly managing downgrade risk as opposed to default risk because of the quality of the portfolio. Certainly if commodities today as low or go lower over the next couple years then we could actually see that turn more into default risk; but for the moment it seems to be more downgrade risk.
 But important to note, too, I mentioned some losses -- or some sales we made which obviously would've been losses. Despite the losses that we took in Q3 and Q4 in terms of managing down that portfolio, credit losses for the year were still well below historical levels and well below planned levels. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that we took a bath in Q4.
 So from that perspective, I think the portfolio is in good shape. Very defensive. We been managing it down, and we're not seeing any capital issues coming out of that any time in the near term.
 Then finally, despite a challenging set of markets in 2015, we were able to grow the business, continue to see strong cash flow off the in-force book. So we were able to chip in a little something extra again in Q4 like we did last year, so we sent another $100 million up to the center in December, bringing our total dividend for the year up to $710 million, which is a new record for Jackson and, as I think I mentioned last year, actually exceeds the original purchase price for Jackson, so that's a good story from that perspective.
 I'll end on a good note like that, and I'm going to send it back over to Barry just to wrap things up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, so we'll go to Q&amp;A in just a moment, but I would just close by reminding you of some of the points we've tried to leave with you today. Jackson has got a long but more importantly a growing reputation and history as an industry leader, leading both commercially and as a thought leader. We continue to believe strongly in advice as a critical component of any retirement plan; that's why we're reacting the way we are to DOL and working on solutions to ensure that consumers continue to receive the advice they desperately need as they try to work out their retirement plans.
 Best-in-class customer service delivered at an incredibly competitive cost. It's another demonstration of the fundamental consumer-centricity of the products we sell, how we sell them, and how we service them.
 Financial strength and ratings, capital generation give certainty to consumers at a time when they desperately need it. Prudent pricing and product design do the same thing; they deliver strong benefits for consumers at a reasonable cost.
 We've not really touched on -- Mike touched on it, I think, a little bit earlier, and we're happy to take it in Q&amp;A -- we've not really talk a lot about the prospect of bolt-ons. We're still very much in the market for those deals. We're hopeful, in fact, that some of the noise that's occurring in the US market now might shake a couple opportunities loose. I think there is the prospect that that might happen.
 And key to our history, to our success, and key to our future is our track record of creativity and innovation around product. This is a dimension of thought leadership that I think you'll see more and more from us.
 So those are key points we want to land with you, and with that I'll ask Chad us to come back up and we'll do a little Q&amp;A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right, questions for Barry and Chad? Why don't we start with Blair here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Stewart,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks very much, gents. A couple of questions. Firstly, on DOL, do you expect fire-sale conditions as we go through this year in advance of any change? And if so, would you relax your self-imposed restrictions on sales volumes?
 Secondly, more generally, Barry, do you see a situation where the outcome on DOL is so bad that VAs just disappear from the agenda of distributors and customers?
 And Chad, for you, how do you guard against the risk of ratings migration, because a big segment of the book is in BBB? How do you see that risk? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [3]

 The first part of your question on a fire sale, it depends on not just what the rules says but how they propose that the implementation occur and how much time and so forth. So I guess the answer is it's hard to say. It depends.
 Chad has already alluded to the fact that, depending on how this lands, we have been constraining, managing sales with a lot of discipline over the last four or five years. There is the prospect that we could reintroduce some product elements that we've not been focused on for the last few years.
 We certainly wouldn't do anything in an indisciplined way to try to run up sales in expectation of a famine, because we do not see a famine coming. We think we've always -- we've also tried to articulate that point.
 So I don't think there is a scenario where that's the outcome. But you could see us reintroduce some things that we've done in the past. But nothing to drive, again, huge volumes of sales in anticipation of the famine.
 I don't see the prospect that VA disappears. It's too important.
 The VA has got a bad rap. The industry has collectively done a very poor job of telling the very important story of VAs, how valuable they are, the unique role that they should play in the retirement of many people, particularly middle-class Americans.
 One of the things we are committed to do going forward is assuming some of that leadership role and becoming a more public and visible advocate for these products. Because they are important, they are meaningful. And we've candidly let people who really don't understand the importance of the product criticize it, and we've let that criticism go unanswered. And we can't let that happen anymore as an industry. Over to you.

 Sure. On the ratings migration question, we address it a couple different ways. Part of it is BBB position sizes are just smaller than anything else we do. A typical BBB position size is going to be in the $120 million, $150 million size, so it's pretty manageable coming into it.
 We are proactive with respect to looking at ratings migration. Obviously as things are sliding or more under stress then we are looking to mitigate the sizing of that as it might go high-yield. That's actually part of some of the sales we would've done in Q4.
 But again, we're starting at a low enough base that we actually can deal with some of the migration in the high-yield without it being particularly disruptive. Again, part of that just starts with reasonable position sizes to begin with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Want to go to Oliver here, please.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Three questions. The first is, what sort of products are you thinking about to tackle the Millennials? Because I don't think your current VA offering suits them particularly well.
 Secondly, what sort of scope in terms of size to bolt-ons are you looking for? And is that to be funded out of the US block of capital or elsewhere?
 And thirdly, if we go back to that chart you showed of the rising sales pretty much ever since 2003, with a little bit of a blip in 2007, at some point we're going to see outflows from that. So perhaps you can just take us through the hypothetical modeling of those outflows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. The first question on what kind of products: You're talking about in response to DOL, Oliver?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, for Millennials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oh, for Millennials. Okay, I'm sorry. Well, this is still very much stuff on the drawing board. But fundamentally what we've been doing historically with VAs -- the value of VAs is that they allow people to continue to accumulate while they begin contemplating de-cumulation.
 We've already got the ingredients in house to build a more robust accumulation portfolio. So the logic that would prevail, I guess, is if you're starting to sell to people when they're 35 and 40 and 45 instead of 60 and 65, that it's an accumulation story. So I guess the fundamental difference that you would see from us years from now as this rolls out is more of an accumulation play as opposed to just a de-cumulation play.
 In terms of the size of bolt-ons and how they would be funded, I think I'd probably flip that to Mike who I suspect will tell you to stop asking the question. But, Mike, you want to --?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, okay, and --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've seen very little ever in the US that is worth any sort of goodwill. So the question is price, the structure, how broken is it. Some of the better value that the Jackson team can unlock is if someone has got structural or systems issues in a back book where a private equity buyer, for example, just can't take it.
 So it really varies transaction by transaction, and it varies where we are as a Group with capital. But we're clearly comfortable diversifying the US business if we get the right returns; but like everything else in the Group it's got to be the right numbers.
 There's been a bid up, as you are all well aware of, some of the Japanese buyers in the US properties lately. We've passed or wouldn't look at anything at those sorts of numbers. There is not a need to do this; it stays opportunistic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Then on the outflows, as I showed on the net inflows, we don't have to grow the gross sales at all really to continue to have very robust inflows. I think we've seen a very persistent back book. We're continuing to see, I think actually increased persistency as there's just fewer alternatives in the market.
 We offer the best product in the market, so it's really hard to find a good reason to leave our product. So I think we've seen very, very good persistency.
 And absent that dynamic changing, new entrants, massively higher interest rates, things like that, we'll probably continue to see very good persistency. I think we'll be able to see some growth in both the Elite Access side of it and the guarantee side of it to keep flows going.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Can I just come back to you on that? I thought after 10 years typically your customers were starting to take the outflows. Really were starting to take the withdrawals --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm sorry, after 10 years they were --?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oliver Steel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I thought after 10 years that your customers were starting to take the withdrawal benefit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I mean if they take the withdrawal benefit they are still on the books. So that depends on how the market is doing, right?
 If they're taking a 5% withdrawal and the market's going up 7% a year, we actually have more of their money at the end of the year than we do at the beginning; so that will be market dependent.
 But, yes, after a while, they will start taking withdrawals. But that's in those net flow numbers I was showing you.

 Jon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. I've got three questions, please. I just wanted -- I think it was Barry who mentioned that some of the broker-dealers are becoming risk-averse ahead of DOL coming in. I just wonder; is there an outcome from DOL where you lose some of the distribution footprint expansion that you've seen since the crisis, as you get back to more of an independent financial planner bias? This is the first question.
 Second question, the Millennials, to come back on Oliver's question. Does this necessarily have to be an insurance product? Because it strikes me that you're the only bit of the life group globally that doesn't have an asset management unit associated with it. Could this be actually a mutual fund type of operation you could build?
 And then finally, just for Barry, I thought -- you've been in Asia a long time. What are your perspectives coming from Asia, going back to the US and seeing how the market looks? I wonder if there's any things that leap out at you from that perspective?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't think I said anything about broker-dealers being risk-averse. But it's right; who ever said it's absolutely right. Must've been Mike.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That was me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It was you? Oh, okay. Somebody. It's absolutely correct.
 We've seen pressure on Cetera already for a variety of reasons. That's not just -- that's not DOL necessarily centric.
 But we see some others. We see movement at AIG.
 But there's a different way to look at that. If you think that there are going to be a lot of reps that are going to be disrupted because broker-dealers are reacting badly, overreacting, whatever, to this, you could say, oh, you might lose distribution. In reality I think it's the opportunity to gain distribution.
 One of the things that we could do that's potentially innovative is if we're able to craft the right product and technology solutions for advisors, we may attract more advisors. While the NPH network of broker-dealers is already large -- 3,500, 4,000 advisors are part of that network -- that could grow. So I think that's one of the dimensions of the opportunity that we could face.
 What does the Millennial product look like? I can answer that more definitively later, so I'm just blue-skying here with you now. But, yes, there's certainly the prospect that it wouldn't necessarily be a pure insurance product, that there would be other dimensions of it.
 We've got, obviously, investment management capability within the Group, within the North American Group, and we could leverage that in the future differently than we have today or in the past. So that's certainly a prospect we could look at.
 Back to the US, it's funny. Some people have told me that in only six or seven months back in the US that I've developed a Southern accent. I can't imagine that that could possibly be the case, having been gone for so long.
 But other than talking funny, I guess the thing that probably has been most striking to me, candidly -- and this will sound like a set-up answer, but -- is the importance of what companies like Jackson do and the lack of appreciation for it. I guess what's most astonishing for me, at the risk of insulting the entire industry, is how poorly the industry has organized itself to be an advocate for the fundamental social utility of what we do across the board, all range of products.
 In any industry, you will always find people who are better operators and worse operators, and so there's always something to criticize. But again, as I said earlier, the criticism of some really important dimensions of our industry, in my view, has gone unanswered. And I think it's really our responsibility to step up, as a highly successful, highly competent, capable organization with enormous consumer-centricity.
 It's our responsibility to step up and provide more of the leadership, given the state of affairs. So it's one of the things that I think the whole team is looking forward to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just behind you, Andy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Hughes,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, thanks. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. A couple of questions if I could. The comment about institutional looking attractive at these spread levels, that only makes sense if you have a different asset mix to the back book of Jackson.
 So it begs the question: If the institutional business looks attractive at these spreads, will you move Jackson's back book in to attract a bit more credit risk in the book as well? Because obviously if it looks good to the new business, you must be thinking to re-risk the general account generally, ex-energy.
 And the second question is on VAs. If the DOL reforms come in, is it your expectation that lapse rates are going to fall? And are lapse rates falling anyway in the market?
 And how much impact does that have in terms of EEV and reported numbers for Jackson, please? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On the institutional side, it's not a back book play. It's just when we look at -- even on a de-risked portfolio, we're just seeing more spread widening between credit tiers. So we're raising institutional funding effectively off of our AA credit rating; it's a policyholder liability.
 You don't have to go down to BBB- to make that work. Even in an A-, BBB+ range the spreads are there for it to make sense.
 That's actually somewhat newish. It took a long time for financial paper to recover, to tighten back in post-financial crisis. It finally did; but about the time it did, spreads across the entire credit spectrum really had collapsed, so there just wasn't that opportunity there.
 We're seeing now, as you're getting disconnectedness in the credit spectrum, those opportunities are there again. So I'm not saying we're going to go raise $20 billion of institutional; I'm just saying we are -- you think about it in the context of we're talking about $0.5 billion numbers on fixed annuity, being able to do the $750 million benchmark deal we did in Q4, it moves the needle relative to that. And it's good business at good profit.
 In terms of lapse rates falling, there's been -- I think there was -- I'm sure many of you are familiar; there is a Milliman study out relatively recently showing a general decline in lapse rates within the industry. I think that clearly there is a trend towards that.
 It makes sense, given the new products. I mean it's hard to find a product other than ours -- I'm very self-serving -- hard to find a product other than ours that you would rather want to have than one of the back book products from most writers, including us. Because, as I mentioned, we've become a little bit less pricing friendly over the last several years. So you're better off with an old Jackson policy than a new Jackson policy in some respects, depending on your situation.
 So I think that's led to a lower drift in lapse rates just in general. Not a monumental one, but they are drifting that direction.
 So I think there, yes, that will be positive, generally speaking on EEV; that just is the direction of that. It will be a mixed bag on IFRS because of the above line, below the line type of thing. And it will be generally pretty neutral for statutory is the broad spectrum how that will play out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik Musaddi,  JPMorgan Cazenove - Analyst   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Just a quick question on -- is there any limit on how much high-yield you can hold on your general account in the US following any possible rating migration?
 And secondly, can you give us some thoughts about, like, rating migration in US? How does it impact, obviously, ratio? Any sort of numbers would be interesting. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I didn't quite catch the tail end of the last one. The short answer to your first question is we have a soft limit of 8% of high-yield within our overall investment policy. So we have a lot of room to deal with ratings migration, if necessary. But we would tend to sell down as it goes.
 I'm sorry, what was the question relative to RBC?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ashik Musaddi,  JPMorgan Cazenove - Analyst   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is impact of rating migration on RBC? Is there any formula that, like, okay, if BBB goes to BB, you need to hold X% more capital for that asset?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Right. There's a pretty good jump between BBB and BB in terms of RBC requirements. That tends to get mitigated by the fact that, again, we're tending to reduce positions before things go to noninvestment-grade. So I would say, we could withstand a very material amount of ratings migration before we would notice anything particularly problematic in the RBC ratio.
 It's really -- if I think about this in terms of a normal bad credit cycle, that typically is going to be measured maybe in the couple hundred million -- $200 million, $300 million, $400 million type of range. It's the situations where an entire asset class like RMBS goes upside down, like we saw last time around, where you have that tacked onto a normal credit cycle that becomes more noticeable in RBC. But even there we were able to manage through that pretty well because the in-force is throwing off so much cash.

 Last one, please. Greig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. Greig Paterson. Three questions. The first one is I wanted to give you some color on the VA hedging going through the various [grids].
 Second thing, you mentioned the $4.6 billion appetite for VA has been pretty constant for the last two or three years. I wonder what your view -- what the policy is for 2016 in terms of appetite for VAs with guarantees.
 Then also, notice on slide 15 there was a strange feature in terms of 2018. Both the back book and the new business profit signature suddenly dips down for a year and then starts picking up again. I was just wondering what's going on there. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig, I'm sorry. The first question, what was it on VA hedging that you wanted?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Some color.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Could you just describe (multiple speakers) where your hedging strategy is now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. In terms of the VA hedging, so just a refresher. We look at this on an economic basis; that's the core way we look at the business. Obviously, we look at the accounting as well as an overlay. So if there is additional hedging needs to be done to support statutory capital we do that as well.
 But within the economic world, the way we look at it, we hedge the delta. That's obviously a pretty straightforward one.
 We're much more focused on the gamma or effectively the move in delta for instantaneous shocks, gaps in the market. So we're very focused on gamma, which is why we have a large option book.
 We also are focused on rho, but not thinking about it in a market-consistent way. This is where the economics and the accounting get a little bit different. We're thinking about that in terms of the discounting of the cash flows as opposed to assuming that if rates drop then therefore all future equity market returns drop as a market-consistent scenario would have. So we manage rho on again more of a cash flow to the economic basis as opposed to a market-consistent basis.
 And volatility we include that in our capital requirements internally, but we don't specifically hedge vega on the book.
 With respect to risk appetite, we've been at the $4.5 billion. I think that's an ongoing conversation in terms of how we're going to look at it going forward. We're looking at things, as I mentioned in that one slide, on more of a risk-weighted basis.
 Clearly if you look at it from a pure risk budgeting perspective, there is sufficient upside there to take that higher. But yes, there's a lot of headwinds there.
 We have DOL; we don't know what's going to happen there. Could be a fire sale, as was mentioned before. It could dry up ahead of time. We could be shifting in the middle of all that.
 So I guess the big question is, it depends. But overall it's a risk appetite and market condition type of situation.
 In terms of the profit signature on the EEV, it was like year four or so you're saying it was -- three or four is dropping? Yes, that would be the -- that's basically just the L share, which is the shorter surrender charge period. It's got a cliff surrender charge; it's like 7, 7.6 type of thing. And there are 7.65 and then just disappears.
 So what you see there is basically the lack of surrender charge protection. You're effectively having to pay that off in that year, which is why it dips. Does that make sense?
 It's referred to as the L share version. So it's a shorter surrender charge version of the traditional VA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you for your questions. We'll just take a moment to get set up for the wrap-up and Q&amp;A.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, final session. Q&amp;A. What have you got left? What do you want to know? And we'll pull help from our colleagues in the audience if we can't answer it. Greig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Anyone other than Greig who wants a shot at this? All right, Greig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What do you want to know about next year's numbers? What kind of projections? But go ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, what I thought was interesting, though, is I was speaking to your new UK Chairman yesterday and going through the reasons why you've appointed a UK Chairman, given you want to -- it's not about breaking up the Group. And people might interpret it like that, so it might be interesting for you to talk about that.
 But it's about he said having a higher standard of corporate governance. The thing I noticed is that your US CEO is a Chairman and a CEO. So doesn't that -- isn't there some kind of inconsistency there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, it's just a question of timing; it's a good question, Greig. We are adding independent chairs, independent risk, independent audit. Again, a number of our subsidiaries had independent directors throughout -- New York had them; Asia had a number -- and independent risk and audit. But we're formalizing that process.
 It improves the governance model. It's in cooperation with the regulator here, just seeing an industry best practice.
 But just given the size and scale of the organization it's an element to it as well. Any one of these companies would be a listed FTSE entity into itself. And there's a lot of other soft benefit to it as well.
 But we're in process on some of the others, and you'll see us continue to announce that. But that's the only -- it's a timing issue, Greig. We want to make sure we get the right people, and do the right due diligence in backgrounds, and obviously getting -- we want the same quality and governance we do with management.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm not criticizing the move.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, no, no. It's -- I think he took it in the spirit it was delivered. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'll talk to you afterwards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Fine. Anyone else?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Anything else? The shortest Q&amp;A we've ever done. There was a couple hands?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, [Hanne]?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member   [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. Could you possibly talk about the sensitivity of the Asian IFRS earnings to substantially lower equity markets?
 And then, similarly in the US, I think, Nic, you mentioned in the morning that I think you said you were more hedged to a 20% market drop than a 40% market drop. Can you just expand on that, please?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, the question on IFRS --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Asian sensitivity to equities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Asian sensitivity of IFRS profits to equities?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member   [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Correct, yes; I know (multiple speakers) is insurance (multiple speakers).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I think Adrian referenced that there is a proportion of our -- when you look at the sources of earnings in Asia, the vast majority are, of course, health and protection driven, 60%, 67%. The next biggest component is becoming fees, fee-based business. This is the fees that we charge on the unit-linked funds.
 Interesting, not everyone -- not all these funds are necessarily backed by equities. A number of them are backed by bonds in a number of our markets. So, yes, they are -- that is a little more susceptible to market movements. But given that its contribution is not that significant, it's not something that we are unduly worried about.
 As regards -- I think that it's the reference to the asymmetry between the equity shock sensitivity at minus 20% and minus 40%, this does change from this -- you should expect that to vary depending on where we are in a particular point in the year. It just so happened that at that particular point, there was stronger protection for minus 20%, and that's why you see that element of asymmetry come through that sensitivity.
 But again, it's many moving parts within the organization where we have equity risk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member   [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. So the hedging strategy in terms of what shock are you hedged to changes (multiple speakers)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. I mean yes, the hedging strategy, clearly it's quite involved, and you have to take a number of inputs into account. Chad just referenced a number.
 So, yes, what you see there is the outlook of where that hedging position was at the end of June.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair here, please.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Stewart,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So just trying to pull a few of the pieces together from today. You've talked about the Group that's got a healthy stock of capital. You've talked -- I think undoubtedly there will be some slowing of the top line compared to what we've seen over the last few years. The business you're writing is quite capital light; they seem to be very capital-intensive, especially given some of your comments around what you're going to do in the UK.
 You've got certain cash flow targets out there. You talked in some detail, Nic, about some of the stress testing you do around dividend affordability at 2.5 times cover.
 What I'm getting at is: How should we think about dividend policy? Is there scope within the planning period for a significant step up in the dividend given what we've been through today?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I spent some time towards the end of my presentation trying to explain the thinking. I think I'll repeat what we've said before, that we like the healthy cover; dividend will grow in sync with earnings, with the earnings that a growing business delivers. We were only contemplating drawing on cover if we found ourselves in a shock, which is why we shock and we see how well, if you like that, our dividends will be covered going forward post-shock.
 And like we've said again before, we will make those assessments ex ante, rather than necessarily ex post. We are in a good position vis-a-vis all the metrics. So yes, I don't know that there is anything else I would add over and above that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Back there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor Moss,  Berenberg Bank - Analyst   [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, it's Trevor Moss from Berenberg. Just following on really from Blair, I think the thing that differentiates what you've done today so far on your Solvency II disclosures is capital management framework, which a number of others have done. I get your dividend policy; but there was no real framework, I didn't feel, in terms of a business that is so capital-generative, Tier 2 capacity.
 It didn't feel like you had upper and lower limits where you wouldn't want to go, what you might do with the money. There was a little bar in your chart which had corporate actions; obviously, there's going to be money kept aside for stuff like that, bolt-ons in the US, etc.
 But I think other companies have and will do capital management frameworks, which doesn't seem to be something you've done. That's the first question.
 And secondly, on Eastspring, I think a few years ago when we were talking about Eastspring there was the beginnings of a buildout of offshore distribution to try and generate more flows offshore rather than onshore in Asia. And that doesn't really seem to have been a feature. I wonder if that's one of the few disappointing aspects to Eastspring, the development of that.
 And thirdly, I think it's probably for Barry and/or Chad. You made reference, Barry, that you're the only real VA writer still with open architecture, and many of your competitors have narrowed the fund range down enormously. I wonder what challenges and risks that gives the business.
 I sat with one of your competitors just a little while ago who was suggesting to me that in fact you were taking enormous amounts of risk by having such an open architecture system and that you must be mad, effectively. Which doesn't seem the Jackson way, so I just wondered how you might answer that question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Where to start? On the capital framework, I'll let Nic fill in the details, but I think what we've done is more disclosure, not a -- don't confuse that with a lack of a defined capital framework.
 The other piece I think that shouldn't be lost to anybody today is you've got a new head of our UK life business with a very heavy capital management investment hedging background, because a key element of running a life company in the UK is going to be capital management moving forward.
 But I wouldn't confuse the level of disclosure with a lack of discipline or a model. I don't know what you want (multiple speakers).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I hear what you're saying. There are two points I would make.
 The first point is there is a -- we have a very different business footprint, which introduces a number of, if you like, different parameters, perhaps by -- when compared, if you like, to other organizations where the vast majority of the business is concentrated in one geographic region as opposed to being spread over three regions. And therefore, I can see why it would be more relevant for them, if you like, to have -- and I think to have something that then they can say: Yes, this is the bright line, this is the reference; and out of that, off that a whole host of things hang off it.
 For us, given the footprint, it is necessarily that much more involved. As we've said before, I wish it was as simple as managing the business whether it's -- the capital component of the business by reference to one thing; it would make my job easier and a number of other people's job easier. Unfortunately, we're not in that position given the footprint.
 And I guess the other potentially -- and I will reference it -- the differentiating factor is that we have opportunities that I don't think many other people have. Therefore it is absolutely appropriate to retain a degree of flexibility in the thinking around that capital framework.
 We manage it actively. I don't think -- you shouldn't take from my answer that it is random; it is very actively managed, not only at Group but also within our operations. And in that kind of Rubik's Cube way, we try and hit the efficient frontier.
 I appreciate it's difficult to model from the outside, but I think we've done a pretty good job. I guess you can only judge us through a rear-facing mirror in terms of navigating not only challenges that have come from the outside market, but navigating the opportunities that have opened up for us in a way that hasn't stressed us or derailed, if you like, financial strength. So that would be my answer to your challenge.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Eastspring was the next one, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, yes, I'm sorry, on the Eastspring thing, is Guy here? Maybe he can address the ambition that may have been put forward for the offshore in the past.
 But I would say right now, the key -- there's so much opportunity right in front of us in Asia that we can exploit and have done quite well; you've seen the numbers. We've done quite well. So I think we have to be careful that we don't overextend ourselves at this point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Guy Strapp,  Prudential plc - CEO, Eastspring Investments   [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'll just comment on the -- we opened in the US in Chicago three years ago. We booked some very healthy business out of South America and out of the Chilean pension schemes in 2015. We have our first US pension account that we are in IMAs with right now.
 So I think the America thing is happening on about pace. It takes three years to win institutional business.
 In the UK, it's two years since we opened the office, and I think we've seen very strong flow from the private banks, IFAs, platforms, and institutions, Dutch pension funds to name some. So yes, of the GBP80-odd billion, it's true that only a couple of billion pounds comes from those two segments, but I think that's about par for the course in terms of two- and three-year-old businesses and we hold strong hopes for continued growth.
 But I'd say the UK/Europe experience is slightly ahead and US is on course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barry Stowe,  Prudential plc - Chairman &amp; CEO North America   [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, and on the investment freedom part of the question, I will let Chad chime in, in a moment, and give you a more technical answer. But I've heard this from years. Even though I was out of the States for almost 20 years, I maintained relationships with people and I'd be back in New York or whatever. I'd go and see good friends in senior positions at various different competitors in the US market, and I would periodically hear from people: Gosh, we look at what Jackson does and we don't really understand how they do it.
 So this has been a recurring theme. But the reality is, Jackson has consistently done it. And it comes down to the team, the capability, the manner in which products are built, priced, serviced, managed, and importantly the way the risks that we accept have been mitigated through what is clearly the most effective hedging program in the industry.
 And the reason we're willing to take the risk we take is because we've demonstrated time and time again that we understand how to manage that risk profitably. But Chad, you might want to add some technical color.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chad Myers,  Prudential plc - EVP &amp; CFO Jackson National Life Insurance Company   [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I'd say a couple things to that. One is, I think what people lose sight of is that what we refer to as investment freedom used to just be the VA market. So prior to companies doing a lot of damage to themselves in the crisis, this is -- the way we're doing it now is the way everybody used to run the business.
 Nobody had massive capital problems or ended up in bankruptcy because of basis risk. They ended up in the situation they did because they chose to hedge the accounting instead of the economics, or they just chose not to hedge at all. So those are just bad decisions that you can't overcome.
 I think, frankly, they've not really been allowed to play with sharp objects since then. Because if you're not able to manage that type of business, the easiest thing to do is to go to investors or the Board and say: Hey, look, we figured it out; we got this algorithm; it's going to de-risk everything, and we're out of the risk business.
 I'm actually personally a lot less comfortable letting a model determine all the hedging and the de-risking. I think we're going to -- I'm actually quite interested to see how our competitors fared and specifically the ones that were in the vol-controlled asset allocation space in Q4. Because when you get a rapid drawdown and a run back up -- anecdotally I am hearing that we're going to see a lot of the guaranteed funds are going to have fairly significantly underperformed the S&amp;P, which didn't have a particularly good year anyways. I think there's a lot of operational issues that weren't necessarily thought through on the front end.
 So you're turning the risk management over to a model as opposed to being able to tangibly look at what you have, the risk that you have, and hedge it accordingly.
 I'd also say that any type of basis risk, it tends to be a short term versus a long-term thing, so obviously you can get short-term dislocations there. If you think about it over the last 24, 36 months, the S&amp;P -- and more specifically about six stocks in the S&amp;P -- have outperformed the entire world. It's been a horrible time for active management.
 Yet we're not struggling through with large losses on basis risk. So I would say from our perspective, we've had good success with it. I think the industry had good success with it prior to that.
 And I guess the last little commercial for it would be that having a diversified portfolio like we do, not having everything on the S&amp;P, actually tended to see our funds outperform with large drawdowns in the market. Because you do have more diversification there; it's much, much broader diversification.
 I think last comment on that would also be that, if for some reason we weren't able to manage it, we would discontinue investment freedom. That's clear. So if we saw a behavior that was anti-selective and was going against us, then we wouldn't take the risk.
 But we think it's very manageable at this point in time, and we actually think the industry's got some risk that they might not appreciate within the vol-control funds.

 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jon Hocking,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. I've got three questions please. I just wondered firstly on Solvency II: it's obviously painful getting to where you ended up and it's increased the complexity of running the Group's capital measurement framework. But do you think the Group's ended up having a commercial disadvantage from running a global business from Europe?
 Or would you think Russia -- where you've ended up actually it's painful (inaudible). You made a commercial difference. That's the first question.
 Second question. Nic, when you mentioned paying two interim dividends, do you just mean 50-50 phasing? Second question.
 And then finally, during the Asia presentation I think somebody mentioned that in Indonesia the consumer confidence index has come down but some leading indicators have turned up. I just wonder what those indicators were and how reliable they'd been in the past. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So I'll take the Solvency II at the Group level and effectively the domicile part of that. What is measurable is the cost of Solvency II. We're GBP300 million roughly into the project, so there's clearly value bled there.
 It is -- as I mentioned earlier, you will see multiple iterations of Solvency II. I drew the analogy of Microsoft's Office I think we'll be on 8.0, and at some point it will be an incredibly effective set of metrics, but there is the framework for some interesting information and looks at a business in it; and there is I think an open dialogue with the regulators here to take as far as they've got and say: Now, what would a better version be? So I do think we'll be talking about Solvency II in future meetings, and not in jest because it's 2.1 or 2.2 or enhancements to it that will give greater clarity.
 Clearly this is not a great fit for us as a capital regime. That doesn't mean it defines our domicile and clearly it doesn't give you particularly the ability to compare our number with a European peer with a US peer or with an Asian peer.
 So there's no -- the original goal 20 years ago with a series of European regulators sitting around a table was the idea of comparability, and that is not the way it's landed. So there is more work to be done, there's more investment to be made, there's more resources to commit to it. But I think it is in the course of our business -- you heard it in the Asia presentation -- regulations change.
 And the expectation in the markets -- we do business in all of them -- that we adapt to those changes as they go and meet their demands. And we're big enough to have a seat at the table in this. Nic chairs the CFO Roundtable on this one; we've had outstanding line of sight. We're one of the people the bank talks to when they want to know impacts.
 Penny in her previous role and her current role as CRO was as close to the bank as probably anybody on this project. So with our scale, again, we have influence. But I think it's reasonable if we have a global footprint that we're going to deal with global regulation and I don't personally see a global alignment coming. So this is a cost of doing business at our size and the markets we've chosen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The interim? Okay; apologies. I should've done a better job of explaining it. But the clock had got to zero by the point I got to that part of my presentation.
 It is purely a technical labeling change. To explain, it is Solvency II related.
 The Solvency II rules say that you cannot recognize the contribution to your capital from ordinary shares that we've issued. So we have a line on our accounts that says share capital and share premium, that contributes a About a couple of billion to the total. So the rules say that you can only recognize that fully if you have the ability to cancel a dividend. That's the rules.
 Now, our Articles of Association say that when the Board proposes a dividend to an AGM, it can no longer retract it. That would have disqualified 2 billion of our share capital, effectively of our capital stack, from counting under Solvency II.
 And it's true for all the UK players. We have the option of changing our Articles, and one of our competitors is doing that.
 We had the option of either declare or proposing in a notice to the AGM a final dividend with the words "but this could be canceled up until it's approved," which we thought that would look ridiculous. Or we had the option of sites that do both of those things by simply calling our final dividend a second interim dividend.
 So that's the full story, if you like. As I said, Standard Life have changed their articles of -- even L&amp;G. We'll probably wait and see what your reaction is to what I've just said. I think they will probably -- they may well follow us.
 In terms of the timing of when we pay it, and the quantum in terms of the one-third, it doesn't change that. It's simply a technical change, a labeling change.
 And of course the other effect of that is that we're not going to be -- it's not going to be approved at the AGM given that it's effectively declared by the Board. So, there we are. That's the full story.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So, Jon, if we were looking for an example of where there may not have been value created from a workstream, that's how we get back to where we were. But we get there again when the current regime and everyone is intact.
 And so then a question on Indonesia, Tony?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tony Wilkey,  Prudential plc - Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia   [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Indonesia CSI, consumer sentiment index, which has been published on a monthly basis now for about five years, I think in August or September of last year fell below 100 for the first time. What you should've heard today was I think Lilian said in December it stopped falling. It didn't go back up, but it stopped falling in December.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think there was a miscommunication on a question, too, to Adrian about shape of IFRS in Indonesia, ex-sales. The back book effectively would be low double digits without sales. Is that directionally correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, no. What Adrian showed in the line that was going down, that's simply effectively the IFRS profile if you simply run off the business. In other words, if you don't write a single unit or a single cent, dollar of new business.
 If you sustained the same level of sales each year, in other words, with no growth on the sale, but we do whatever it is, 300 million of AP, if that was to sustain, then IFRS would increase. Because you'd be adding another valuable cohort.
 And he didn't illustrate the 0% growth, but that would've been upward sloping, out sloping. He did illustrate 5% and I think 15%, which geared that slope up further.
 But what he actually showed is if you put the business in run-off, which clearly isn't our intent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Back of the room there. Gordon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gordon Aitken,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks. Gordon Aitken from RBC. Couple of questions.
 One on transitionals, and just to take you back to one of the very first question you were asked this morning about benefit of the transitional relief on the UK annuity book, just can you remind us of when you have to disclose that number? And also if you can talk about why you felt you shouldn't disclose the number and the benefit, given it was hugely important in the banking sector -- in the European banking sector.
 And the second question is on annuities. You've set out your lack of desire for future retail annuities, and obviously not a lot of talk about annuity back books being on the market in 2016. Would there be a scenario where you would look to sell your UK annuity back book? Obviously you've got some annuities in the [with-pro] fund and some outside, so if you can talk about that, thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nic Nicandrou,  Prudential plc - CFO   [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, let me start with the second part of your transitions question on the banking, because I think it's important to understand the distinction. Basel III, and maybe -- I'm sure a number of you know it -- but Basel III came in and introduced some additional and, if you like, increased the requirements of banks because candidly the previous requirements had failed to prevent the failure of banks during the last financial crisis. But in order to give banks time, it staggered the requirements over a number of years. So it allowed us banks to transition from whatever Tier 1 ratios, for example, they were coming out of the financial crisis to -- or in 2013 when Basel III was introduced, as they moved towards meeting the eventual standards.
 That's where the comparison starts and ends in terms of it's the same name, which is unfortunate. Solvency II, the capital requirements have been set; so we're not transitioning as banks were to a new set of capital requirements by 2017, 2018, 2019. They are set.
 Unlike banks, which ultimately had the ability to reprice effectively their exposures, we don't have that ability. So what transitionals do is effectively trying to get a set of a business which cannot be repriced which was priced in old regimes to be accommodated, if you like, within the new regime.
 So, it's different in its nature. It is valid, not only the PRA, but EIOPA have also reinforced that view regularly.
 And I go back to what I said during the presentation, that, yes, this will run off; but the additional release that you get from the risk margin and the SCR will broadly compensate and we're left with a third-order effect.
 So it's very -- the reason that we're introduced here is very different to banks. Unfortunate that we have the same name, but that's where the comparison starts and stops.
 As for the disclosures, the first set of disclosures that will be provided will be in relation to the full year's end -- full-year 2016 balance sheet. It will be the annual returns that the entire insurance industry will have to submit.
 The deadline or the timeline for that is the summer of 2017. And believe me, you are going to get a hell of a lot of information to your heart's content at that point.
 The objective of what I was presenting wasn't to effectively front run that voluminous data set that you will get in about 15, 16 months' time, but to give you a quite clear steer on where Solvency II bites, is relevant, which is at the Group and at the UK level, and to run you through how we've dealt with the uncertainties.
 So, I never set out with the intent to replicate what you will see in 16 months' time, and I hope I have done that. You'll get lots and lots of information at that point, as I said, when those QRTs are, including with the matching adjustment may be contributing, including all sorts of things that European companies I guess are relying on as part of the long-term guarantee package. Retail annuities?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure, I'll pick that one up. As with respect in our presentation, we clarified our position on new business, and it probably follows that that decision moves to our back book. So when we talk about optimizing the in-force, that's precisely what we'll do, and we will look to use any tools that we can to do it.
 We're in no rush to do it, and we will use resources in other parts of the organization. So in Prudential Capital where we do a lot of financial engineering transactions on behalf of a number of companies in the Group, in PPMG, but also obviously in the teams that we have in the UK.
 I don't know where the market will go. We hear that there will be back books on the market. There's somebody said $1.4 trillion of bulk annuities coming. This is a big churn is what it sounds like.
 Our job will be to optimize that. But we know where we want to go. We want to wind it down.
 But as I say, there's no rush, there's no set plan, and we will take advantage of opportunities as they come up. Inevitably almost all -- I can only guess that almost all of the market is already talking to us about it. Being the PRU you get to see what's going on, and then you'll decide what you might want to do. So that's the best answer I can give to that question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raghu Hariharan,  Prudential plc - Director, Strategy &amp; Capital Market Relations   [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Any more? Greig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We'll finish with Greig then?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It has to be you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tradition, Greig.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greig Paterson,  Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods - Analyst   [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Apologize to everyone for holding you; it's Greig Paterson again. I must admit I have to agree with the previous questioner in terms of the capital structure and the framework. You mentioned a large number -- I think it was GBP7 billion or GBP9 billion debt capacity. You talk about in the UK optimizing, i.e., releasing, capital, etc.
 And then you talk -- Nic talks about having flexibility for opportunities, and then when you listen to the full presentation you hear opportunities around ramping up sales in Asia, bolt-ons. But all sort of semi [Gallic] type exercises.
 But you've got this huge capacity that could be deployed in an inorganic way, and I worry -- being a buyer of the stock -- that I'm going to get a pushback. People say: Hey, they're going to buy something, or blah, blah, blah, value destroying. I wonder if you either want to draw a line under there or try and explain what we don't quite understand what's going on here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Wells,  Prudential plc - Group Chief Executive   [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think I told somebody at dinner or our table at dinner last night, one of the -- there was an old unwritten rule here that you didn't talk to previous CEOs, but I've never understood why. You work with some of these people for long periods of time. So one of the things I did when I first took the role was reached out to some of those folks.
 And I had -- on my first week I was going to see our team in Hong Kong, and Mark and I -- Derek and I were going to have dinner and then Jonathan, our communications officer, said really that's not a good photo your first week in the role. Everyone's going to immediately assume big M&amp;A and think -- we don't need to do big M&amp;A, right?
 I'll see Mark this year for dinner; I saw him in Singapore at an event. But there is a -- we're not looking -- we don't need transformational transactions for this Group to grow at pretty material rates. We've gone through the financials with you today, so you can draw your own conclusions with what our capabilities are at a pretty granular level.
 But I think there are different things in the marketplace that are interesting. Again, not trying to brief competitors here and not trying to define our options to US bolt-ons or a very, very large transaction with a competitor.
 That's not -- there's -- goodwill is generally not something that fits in our business plans. If you look at bank distribution in Asia -- Tony's mentioned this -- we are a very attractive partner to banks. We have the most successful relationships in the region; we have the best products and services and team there, I think.
 But we have a good set of relationships both large and smaller. So we're not filling a hole.
 Now that said, we should be able to function in a countercyclical nature. That should be one of the attributes of scale that we demonstrate to you.
 I'd rather we negotiate things -- and this isn't meaning an Asia bank deal, but anything we negotiate we should try and do off-cycle, not when everyone else is chasing the same thing. We've got to -- at our size and our earnings capability and our countercyclical earnings capability, we need to demonstrate to you as shareholders more leverage on that.
 And that goes to capital management, and that goes to how carefully we deploy capital and where it is. So there's no forward-looking statement in that other than we understand how critical it is for us to get that right, and also hope you understand we have the option to get that right.
 Again, been here a long time, seen us surprise a lot of people, not looking to do that, to be very clear. But I think we are a logical player in certain spaces. We're not going to take risks that we're not the logical owner of; I think that's one of the core tenets of the place.
 But we have tremendous opportunities inside of the Group with the businesses we have now to deploy capital at returns that I would argue are as high or higher than anything competitors are getting anywhere in the landscape. So we should maximize that to the capacity of the organization, and we should invest and grow the capacity of the organization at the same time we do that.
 That's about half my wrap-up anyway. Is that a good place to --? So I guess just off that thought, I'll finish up just one more minute here.
 The goal today was to get you to think about if you believe we're in the right markets, if you believe anything material has changed in those markets from a structural point of view as far as opportunity goes, particularly the sense of any of these variables, these disruptions that create uncertainty. Do they change the fundamental demand for what we do? I would argue they don't. If anything, in a number of markets, they increase it.
 Do we have the market position, the attributes of brand, the capability to do it? I think we do. I hope we've demonstrated that to you.
 I think one of the pieces that I am most pleased and proud of is the team we've got now. I hope you had a chance to meet some of the colleagues that aren't up here right now. We'll get them up at different venues.
 But it's our obligation and our privilege as stewards of the Company at this point in its life to take it to another level. As I said at the half-year, I think Prudential can be a lot bigger than it is now in a number of its markets and can do a lot of great things for clients. And those of you that own us, you own capacity that we intend to use carefully.
 But I think it's a very, very unique organization, well positioned, better positioned than it's ever been for the market we're in. Doesn't mean things don't -- we're completely immune to everything in a macro sense. I hope we were clear that wasn't the message today.
 But our ability to weather that and benefit from that I think are unique. And across the cycle, I think, in particular we have an unrivaled position. So looking forward to further developing that.
 One last thing I'd like to do is thank Pip and the crew for last night, for today. All the logistics were flawless; well done. Speaking of the team, you guys did a great job. I think on behalf of all of us, we appreciate that.
 And then to our guests today, we're finishing early, I'll point that out. According to this clock I can talk for 23 minutes and 17 seconds more, which those of you who know me, know I could do easily, one story.
 There's a -- I know how long you've sat here. A number of you have been with us a long time, and you've watched this Company grow and develop and go through a lot. And I appreciate for you to give us this much of your time last night again and then today.
 We know what a commitment that is, and appreciate it very much. Again we'll be here afterwards if you have anything informally you want to say. And on behalf of all of the team, thank you.
