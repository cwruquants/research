7. 200 or 400 milligrams of sotagliflozin and we are reporting today the 24 week primary endpoint patients continued double blinded in
8. to deliver these results that we have shared with you today with that being said we will go from this point
9. the other secondary endpoints besides the primary endpoint we reported today are net benefit body weight bolus insulin dose and fasting
10. then we will find that balance between 200 and 400 today in these pivotal programs we know one thing for sure
11. know if you talked about the timing zone data on today s news yet so thank you very much again for
12. and people living with type 1 diabetes and i think today we are closer to having impact in that regard than

4. benefit 400 is really adding particularly without more information on time and target glucose range and that kind of stuff but
5. doses we also want to see the data relating to time and range and other key secondary endpoints so clearly the
6. continuous glucose monitoring data where we see the amount of time patients stay in the proper range however i can say

4. pleased to share the results with you a word about sotagliflozin it is a first in class dual sglti sglt2 to
5. it diminishes with declining renal function what is unique about sotagliflozin is the sglt1 inhibition that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract
6. 1 diabetes next slide has the phase 3 program for sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes the three main
7. intandem3 intandem1 results have already been reported as successful where sotagliflozin significantly reduced a1c versus placebo with adequate safety today i
8. are randomized to either placebo 200 or 400 milligrams of sotagliflozin all on top of optimized insulin therapy the study was
9. 24 weeks randomized either placebo 200 or 400 milligrams of sotagliflozin and we are reporting today the 24 week primary endpoint
10. and they re randomized to one of two doses of sotagliflozin or placebo that review and assurance that insulin has been
11. important because it provides an assurance that the efficacy of sotagliflozin in this setting is above and beyond what insulin alone
12. of a1c on placebo but there were additional reductions of sotagliflozin 200 and 400 milligrams bringing patients closer to gold on
13. next slide has the adverse event profile the safety of sotagliflozin in the study was excellent the proportion of patients with
14. proportion of patients with adverse events was similar between placebos sotagliflozin 200 and 400 milligrams the incidences of serious adverse events
15. as in intandem1 there is an increase in diarrhea with sotagliflozin 400 milligrams compared to placebo this is not a problem
16. excretion there was an increase in genital mycotic infections with sotagliflozin compared to placebo this was not an issue of discontinuation
17. severe hypoglycemia rates were very low and similar in placebo sotagliflozin 200 milligrams and sotagliflozin 400 milligrams patients were treated safely
18. very low and similar in placebo sotagliflozin 200 milligrams and sotagliflozin 400 milligrams patients were treated safely it was not an
19. committee showed a low incidence it was only 1 of sotagliflozin 400 milligrams it was less than one half of 1
20. milligrams it was less than one half of 1 on sotagliflozin 200 milligrams we were very pleased with this safety experience
21. this safety experience in summary intandem2 met its primary endpoint sotagliflozin significantly reduced a1c providing efficacy above and beyond optimized insulin
22. therapy it s the second successful phase 3 trial for sotagliflozin the first being intandem1 the results are entirely consistent with
23. for type 1 diabetes the profile we are seeing with sotagliflozin in both efficacy and safety is related to its mechanism
24. studies weight loss relative to placebo in patients treated with sotagliflozin and we frankly believe that that is part of the
25. study are you expecting to see larger a1c drops with sotagliflozin in that one versus intandem1 and intandem2 thanks praveen tyle
26. in patients where we want to see the effectiveness of sotagliflozin after insulin has been optimized so this will provide really
27. insulin in a real world setting that you would expect sotagliflozin to give you more reduction on a1c is that a

14. glucose monitoring data where we see the amount of time patients stay in the proper range however i can say that
15. to control it is the severe hypoglycemia that s why patients in this program had lived with type 1 diabetes for

17. consistently across multiple studies weight loss relative to placebo in patients treated with sotagliflozin and we frankly believe that that is
18. dka obviously one of the concerns with the type 1 patients is the incidence of euglycemic dka and i think you
19. provided us with some measures in the past of the patients who had dka but had glucoses less than 250 and
20. we have not dug that data deeper simply because these patients are already ongoing in this study so we have not
21. adverse events is there were two deaths on placebo these patients discontinued one died of lung cancer and one appeared to

24. trials has three components to it the three components are patients who will achieve an a1c below 7 at the end
25. will basically provide a numerical number a quantitative number for patients who have achieved benefits and with no safety adverse events
26. and i guess for intandem1 as well how were the patients with the dkas managed were they taken off the trial
27. on this to be up to the investigator and the patients as to whether or not they continue and if there
28. slide on dka on the 400 milligram dose but other patients stayed in the program and continued and they did well
29. evp and chief medical officer 65 yes it does as patients get into the program it s more common to increase
30. and is insulin optimization continuing in the intandem1 and intandem2 patients for the remainder of the follow up through 52 weeks
31. of some type 2 diabetes and we have evidence that patients are getting above that and we also have evidence that
32. a bunch of parameters it may also be the different patients would benefit from different doses and you mentioned that the

5. in terms of our strategy so we will have additional data in 2017 from this program and there will be some
6. thoughts on 200 versus 400 when i look at this data it looks like 200 is clearly more tolerable or safe
7. kind of stuff but you are generating all the safety data at 400 it s to the extent that 200 ends
8. a possibility that you would need to generate more safety data at that dose or are you kind of covered because

15. integrating this business into telenet s business into the new telenet group business in terms of our further ambitions into wallonia
16. you see more b2b potential than your average within the telenet scope and did they already serve some of the small

8. three potentiators in the game i will present the first phase ii data on 1837 we have two c1s 2222 and

11. will see more data coming out of phase is and phase iis next year but the main goal is indeed to

2. and seven days of placebo treatment is fine for a study but you can t keep patients for longer on placebo
3. patients for longer on placebo so there is in this study not a placebo group which goes along the trial the
4. so there was only one naive patient included in the study endpoints were safety and tolerability and the secondary endpoints were
5. couple of years ago so within the setting of the study patients that were on treatment got a seven day washout
6. the next slide so in total 34 patients entered the study and were screened during the washout period eight patients stepped
7. during the washout period eight patients stepped out of the study for different reasons some did not meet inclusion or exclusion
8. have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of them completed the treatment on the
9. on treatment one patient we dropped inaudible part of the study and one patient was taken out because of creatine phosphokinase
10. to that later and so 24 patients completed the full study and i ll show you the data on these 24
11. comparable to other studies were the patients that entered the study as for the inaudible you will see that the baseline
12. the population we expected and hoped to see in the study next slide please so how did we select the dosages
13. as a group here exceeded our target concentration in the study what you can see as well is the exposure to
14. see a nice drop of sweat over time in the study so sweat chloride is an important parameter because it s
15. of day 9 had clearly lower exposures during the whole study and as a consequence as well they show a lower
16. well they show a lower sweat chloride drop during the study on the left where you see the patients with the
17. very pleased to see that at the end of the study the 29 patients fully returned to the levels of percent
18. with an effective drug so clearly showing that in the study 1837 was able to show an effect of percent predicted
19. non cardiac creatine phosphokinase and was taken out of the study we don t know very well what happened there it
20. will have to watch and as well we need to study whether there is some frequency or what the exact frequency
21. exacerbation a pulmonary exacerbation on the last day of the study so this patient was for the pulmonary exacerbation taken up
22. was a very low incidence of respiratory events in the study so overall the drug as we started the slide was
23. that we were the first group that could perform a study in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the
24. both the patients and the investigator in participating in the study and making this possible this really illustrates the desire of
25. to see that fev levels at the end of the study were at the same level as they were on a
26. on the spread of plasma exposures the patient in the study had a diary and according to the diary the compliance
27. a week two weeks 28 days but not a systematic study that shows when and especially fev and pulmonary exacerbations have
28. s more incidental reporting and really and a well designed study and i don t think anybody really wants to do
29. i don t think anybody really wants to do the study so i think the field is keeping track of what
30. that together so i don t think there is a study out there that really has mapped that out operator 8
31. i believe that the pulmonary exacerbation did well in the study and we were very also the patient of course was
32. moment to take the patient off and out of the study and that s it katherine xu william blair analyst 27
33. the for 2222 in fact we have a three month study ongoing so there the exposure will be longer but it
34. impressive sweat chloride drop that we ve seen in the study so was really in naive naive and showed an increase
35. of patient probably was much better when they entered the study compared to patients that had never seen a drug so
36. was already beginning to plateau at the end of the study and equally in the other group it looks as though
37. at where it was when they entered screening of the study then about the group that reached a target exposure at
38. first i was wondering these patients that enrolled in the study they are actually on stable treatment what is the main
39. to thank the patients and investigators to participate in the study we ve been pleasantly surprised that really this cf field
40. clearly hints to that so timelines for triple with this study well we can confirm anything like that so we are

2. really set a standard for treatment of crohn s disease patients if we switch to cystic fibrosis we are very pleased
3. molecules individually upon healthy volunteers before we can go into patients and the first set of components are in these trials
4. that will address the major medical need amongst the cf patients to put together a triple combination we need one potentiator
5. timeline and our ambition is to bring a triple to patients by mid of next year and that critical timeline is
6. so for the triple combination we aim to bring in patients mid next year that is a combination of 2737 2222
7. portfolio we started a phase ii with 2222 recently in patients as well and you will see more data coming out
8. main goal is indeed to bring the best triple to patients and with that we hope to address both the heterozygous
9. heterozygous delta f508 or the heterozygous minus delta f508 cf patients which in total is about 80 of the cf patient
10. quite well served with the first drug and so most patients are on ivacaftor the second limitation is that it s
11. limitation is that it s ethically not acceptable to put patients on the placebo too long so we can it s
12. is fine for a study but you can t keep patients for longer on placebo so there is in this study
13. goes along the trial the trial was open both for patients that were on treatment with ivacaftor or never had treatment
14. with ivacaftor or never had treatment finally we included 26 patients on treatment and 25 of them were coming from their
15. new setting where we in fact included mainly treatment experienced patients it s very hard to compare the numbers as we
16. of years ago so within the setting of the study patients that were on treatment got a seven day washout and
17. that one month of treatment was again for the washout patients that were on treatment with ivacaftor returned to treatment so
18. s go to the next slide so in total 34 patients entered the study and were screened during the washout period
19. the study and were screened during the washout period eight patients stepped out of the study for different reasons some did
20. showing that indeed the washouts might have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of
21. the washouts might have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of them completed the
22. second phase the last two weeks we ve lost two patients that were on treatment one patient we dropped inaudible part
23. i ll come back to that later and so 24 patients completed the full study and i ll show you the
24. and i ll show you the data on these 24 patients next slide please so how comparable to other studies were
25. slide please so how comparable to other studies were the patients that entered the study as for the inaudible you will
26. split that up according to the different grades our two patients had percent predicted fev of less than 40 for those
27. big increase because it has been shown multiple times that patients with a low percent predicted fev have a hard time
28. an average three years so these are really treatment experienced patients and were on a very stable regimen and that as
29. fact lung function will improve or should improve compared to patients that have never seen a drug and which were published
30. in the in vitro cells where we use cells from patients and for g551d patients it s well know that you
31. cells where we use cells from patients and for g551d patients it s well know that you have to target the
32. the x axis you have the time so day 1 patients have not taken medications on the y axis we depict
33. clearly from this slide is that with the high dose patients as a group here exceeded our target concentration in the
34. liter and sweat chloride is an excellent biomarker in g551d patients so patients have the highest sweat chloride level of around
35. sweat chloride is an excellent biomarker in g551d patients so patients have the highest sweat chloride level of around 100 millimolar
36. is on the left we have the group of 15 patients which exceeded our target levels of day 29 and on
37. 29 and on the right a small group of six patients that did not exceed the target level after day 29
38. after day 29 so what you can see that those patients that did not exceed the target level of day 9
39. during the study on the left where you see the patients with the highest exposure now you can see in fact
40. here the screening fev which presents the mean of the patients on treatment and you ll see a drop of around
41. see that at the end of the study the 29 patients fully returned to the levels of percent predicted fev they
42. us impossible to compare these values with those obtained in patients that have never seen a treatment before on this graph
43. really were in this we had three ses in two patients so one patient showed an acute increase of non cardiac
44. to two facts either fev was further declining either the patients that have been washed out that had some more sputum
45. the first group that could perform a study in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the patients and the
46. in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the patients and the investigator in participating in the study and making
47. to bring forward triple therapies for all of the cf patients compound was safe and well tolerated we saw from week
48. the other hand side you know that the variability in patients typically is higher so we took some safety precautions i
49. but the margin there is quite limited and variability in patients is always going to be a bit higher than what
50. for example produced in its phase ii given that those patients were treatment naive is there results or any data out
51. notion that the washout isn t sufficient to return the patients to a naive baseline piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific
52. been published is on general with more incidental reports of patients that were off the drugged for a week two weeks
53. the clinic are you planning to test it in cf patients or just move on with the safety data piet wigerinck
54. triple for triple how do we move triple combination into patients so it s a mix of phase i and phase
55. should have two out of the three components tested in patients so 2222 is in phase i 1837 has been in
56. we have the time and principal to start testing in patients so it will be only one component 2737 which will
57. there is no adverse pk interaction and then move into patients with out of the triple combo 2737 will be the
58. at that moment is tested for the first time in patients i hope i make it clear not more confusing but
59. the how complex the way to our triple combo in patients currently debjit chattopadhyay janney montgomery scott analyst 11 and then
60. by the pulmonary function based on levels basically so those patients with less than 40 how did they respond i mean
61. how did they respond to your drug and then the patients who were really doing well on kalydeco how did they
62. patient efficacy because if we talk about inaudible about specific patients for the scientific conferences but we will clearly show up
63. by the way i just had a question the two patients that had the saes were they in the exposure above
64. will have in healthy volunteers about two weeks exposure in patients up to one month exposure we especially we ll have
65. way when you want to start to treat the cf patients you really want to give them as soon as possible
66. to be explored first in healthy volunteers and later in patients then the second question was the takeaway what was that
67. for the level of efficacy we hope to bring to patients acceptable but not optimal so that you at least have
68. after two weeks this is the first in treatment experienced patients that something we need to work out further and i
69. was much better when they entered the study compared to patients that had never seen a drug so there is a
70. of different studies difficult impact on 2451 therefore delta f508 patients in terms of triple combo is our main goal there
71. background but i can confirm here that for delta f508 patients there is no difference between 2451 and 1837 and was
72. questions only left please firstly did you monitor at all patients when they returned to kalydeco therapy so i guess was
73. so i guess was there any further gains in the patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients
74. gains in the patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients
75. patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients not followed during
76. patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients not followed during that period and then secondly just with
77. first question was on did we have off visit when patients returned to treatment yes we saw patients when they had
78. off visit when patients returned to treatment yes we saw patients when they had been on treatment back for about a
79. of days to a week between 3 and 10 days patients behaved are expected what i mean is there it s
80. 40 two from my side first i was wondering these patients that enrolled in the study they are actually on stable
81. because it gives me an opportunity again to thank the patients and investigators to participate in the study we ve been
82. up a worldwide impressive effort to improve the life of patients and what we heard from the patient that participated they
83. can contribute to bring novel drugs also for other cf patients that they are willing to participate there and that s
84. really motivated to in general bring more effective drugs to patients more specifically for their group as well i think that
85. desire to see competition there that s one and second patients really want to invest as well in the research for
86. we are on track to bring a triple combination to patients by mid of next year thank you stephanie vogt petercam
87. 2451 as well a combination there of healthy volunteers and patients so it s going to be mixed bag there and
88. test some of the components individual or in combination in patients we will start to do that that really gives us
89. that really gives us a lot of info on how patients what patients feel with this drug how they tolerate it
90. gives us a lot of info on how patients what patients feel with this drug how they tolerate it how variable

3. dose plasma levels so that s a moment in the day where the plasma levels are at the lowest concentration and
4. so on the x axis you have the time so day 1 patients have not taken medications on the y axis
5. the plasma concentration so that is zero and then of day 8 so they have taken one week of the low
6. of the second week in 250 milligram dose bid on day 15 again we take the pre dose value before they
7. pre dose value before they escalate thus you can see day 22 and day 29 they have the same level so
8. before they escalate thus you can see day 22 and day 29 they have the same level so clearly from this
9. well if you look to the exposures were stable between day 22 and day 29 also the sweat outcome is the
10. look to the exposures were stable between day 22 and day 29 also the sweat outcome is the same so showing
11. group of 15 patients which exceeded our target levels of day 29 and on the right a small group of six
12. six patients that did not exceed the target level after day 29 so what you can see that those patients that
13. those patients that did not exceed the target level of day 9 had clearly lower exposures during the whole study and
14. t make any conclusions there what we saw was from day 8 onwards a stable and steady increase with time of
15. important to note as well here is the difference between day 22 and day 29 so this difference here observed as
16. as well here is the difference between day 22 and day 29 so this difference here observed as a mean but
17. and has an exacerbation a pulmonary exacerbation on the last day of the study so this patient was for the pulmonary
18. ve taken the lowest level and the point of the day where the variability is the highest that is what we
19. d review 2737 has the potential of being once a day so we ll see how that turns out once a
20. so we ll see how that turns out once a day for chronic treatment always has a huge advantage so 2222
21. a huge advantage so 2222 has pk of once a day so if 2737 confirms what we hope there i guess
22. she did well but then showed this during the last day the phosphocreatine kinase was probably below but to be 100
23. then about the group that reached a target exposure at day 29 high increase there you re right that at week
24. a small accumulation but that normally should take place by day 22 and should be stable by day and should have
25. take place by day 22 and should be stable by day and should have the same outcome at day 29 then
26. stable by day and should have the same outcome at day 29 then the group that did not reach target levels

2. the design of saphira 1 and let s spend some time here because it s a special design we have to
3. patients with a low percent predicted fev have a hard time showing any improvement and then i ve given as well
4. with exposure so on the x axis you have the time so day 1 patients have not taken medications on the
5. 100 millimolar per liter and what we see is with time and by design as well on the slide by dose
6. and exposure we see a nice drop of sweat over time in the study so sweat chloride is an important parameter
7. fev1 we use again the same x axis which is time have added here the screening fev which presents the mean
8. from day 8 onwards a stable and steady increase with time of the percent predicted fev important to note as well
9. mean but giving the idea that it takes much more time more than the sweat to really get to a maximal
10. 1 as well was important because it s the first time we validate our in vitro assays and so this really
11. explain during the portfolio slide it was more driven currently time wise then by 2737 and as i pointed out as
12. i by that moment 2451 as well we have the time and principal to start testing in patients so it will
13. only component at that moment is tested for the first time in patients i hope i make it clear not more
14. see that the mean of this group really goes with time and those we have convinced them there must be a
15. that to keep all of the graphs in the complex time exposure and sweat a little bit simple on kalydeco the
16. will be longer but it s clear that for the time limiting component 2737 exposure will be limited at the moment
17. placebo and with the fact that this is the first time in treatment experienced patient is two week sufficient i know
18. normal is the variability one by the smaller numbers to time it takes when the variability is highest honestly because it
19. data point onwards lower levels and you see at every time point that that group is low so that s clearly
20. ve been waiting for disease modifying drugs for a long time they ve set up a worldwide impressive effort to improve

8. we would go to a 600 milligram bid or anything like that but the margin there is quite limited and variability
9. of responses of a patient depending on exposure to kalydeco like has that been shown for kalydeco that somebody who has

10. the end we re making a stronger company and i think that will eventually play through we ve talked this year
11. are doing much better than the emerging markets so i think the proof points are starting to build and we re
12. value more margin better margin comparisons of sparkling so i think that part of the problem is the law of big
13. that s the role of a group president and i think james in europe for me certainly lived very much up
14. a way a layer when we did that and i think that is we re going to see the benefits of
15. in the pipeline both revitalized brands revitalized portfolio when you think of the us business i had a fundamental belief that
16. see here there it is on that side and i think flagship the flagship businesses have to perform really well and
17. actually far exceeding some of the emerging markets now i think over time the equilibrium will start playing but i would
18. james quincey the coca cola company president coo 13 i think you did a great job on that one i think
19. think you did a great job on that one i think definitely e all of the above in the end you
20. you would never choose a one trick pony so i think it really has to be e all of the above
21. is the moment for you to exit and how you think the next five to 10 years will look in china
22. business back from him back seven eight years ago i think it was so that was the why and we wanted
23. pulpy launched and all the other still beverages and i think now in your quadrants i would urge you also to
24. quincey the coca cola company president coo 21 so i think a couple of thoughts on china and then connect to
25. to round out by going back to japan as we think about our portfolio and you look at us and say
26. would start to get to be an even lower number think about it like this most people look at japan and
27. the example and that s what we have got to think about for some of these other places we had five
28. for the last eight years or you should have you think you could have done better it would give us maybe
29. maybe where to go and james potentially how do you think about moving innovation much faster from one country to another
30. muhtar kent the coca cola company chairman ceo 29 i think would i have done anything what would i have done
31. embark upon the refranchising quicker after we purchased cce i think there was just too much of integration and synergy work
32. integration and synergy work that had took place but i think at the end of the day my task was to
33. then also reinvigorate the business and the brands and i think we have got there i would have liked to get
34. m a huge believer and the small packages that i think james should talk about and what s happening in the
35. left there is not enough drinks and so again i think james should talk to you about the whole revenue side
36. will have refreshed the vision laughter and i don t think that would obey the maximum of judy s faster decision
37. in the naughties and there was vision 2020 but i think where we are the world we are heading into especially
38. way is how the next 10 years will look i think it is going to be too volatile too much uncertainty
39. but we need to set ourselves some corridors that we think are going to be true and we re going to
40. three years and bets going forward but i don t think we want to be prescriptive all the way out to
41. let s say 50 of the sales mix would you think that s a success or a failure and second question
42. to drink coffee business is all largely in japan we think that there is a lot of space in the us
43. is going to get us to move forward so we think it is going to be interesting and we re going
44. kathy waller the coca cola company evp cfo 44 i think multiple speakers the last question muhtar kent the coca cola
45. kathy waller the coca cola company evp cfo 48 i think you re getting a last question sign from multiple speakers
46. do a three for one then james what do you think about the energy category kathy what do you think about
47. you think about the energy category kathy what do you think about corporate tax reform and the ability to move where
48. ceo 55 then on the board and enterprise risk i think the most important thing is if you look at our
49. the reins whenever he does decades from now so i think that is really the key working with the ceo and
50. company that s the answer you will get and i think we will have to continue that and getting the company
51. t mind first of all congratulations on your investment i think the first question comes to my mind is how does
52. china grows very fast so with this strategic partnership we think that lombard is the best one because first lombard has
53. now is a loss making company listed in nasdaq i think one of the root cause for their loss is their
54. margin so if leverage our microport s manufacturing expertise i think we believe that we can help the lombard company to
55. of course that is with this strategic partnership and we think that s the win win strategy because microport right now
56. corporation svp international business operations amp ir 3 yes i think martin touched on all the strong points it s a
57. is quite strong it s high 20 roughly 30 i think for these devices we viewed the endovascular market is that
58. still have to get approval for altura and so i think a reasonable expectation of peak market share is in that
59. you jessica li bofa merrill lynch moderator 8 great i think everyone is getting ready to celebrate christmas and new year
60. is getting ready to celebrate christmas and new year i think i won t have any more questions so i will
61. international business operations amp ir 9 this is jonathan i think it s probably yearend and so it s been a
62. martin martin sun microport scientific corp cfo 11 yes i think it s good thank you jessica as jonathan mentioned for
63. or analysts want to get more information about lombard i think lombard right now still remain a nasdaq listing public company
64. information about the products about the financials and also i think at the beginning of next year lombard will give also
65. of 2017 to all of the interested investors so i think for this transaction all the information quite be transparent to
66. 2 congratulations and thank you for taking my question i think the number one thing that investors tell me they want
67. coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 3 liana i think that s a very good question i m going to
68. moussatos wedbush securities analyst 5 inaudible microphone inaccessible well i think as we go to the process and make decisions we
69. 6 yes what i can say to that point i think these results excites us all and i think as we
70. point i think these results excites us all and i think as we align with our partners we approached the agency
71. we align with our partners we approached the agency i think with a little bit more timely than i think what
72. i think with a little bit more timely than i think what we may have originally thought through and therefore we
73. into beyond the first quarter of next year so i think we have some great results here and i think we
74. i think we have some great results here and i think we are going to line around the approach with the
75. fda acceptance for review which one of those do you think that you would let us know jeff wade lexicon pharmaceuticals
76. inc evp corporate and administrative affairs and cfo 10 i think as we get additional data from the program it will
77. lexicon pharmaceuticals inc evp and chief medical officer 17 i think we have really we have fully characterized the safety and
78. study is to get additional safety exposure broadly and i think we will have that that study will succeed in that
79. little bit more of a wash and how should we think about the overall profile of this product as it relates
80. this product as it relates to severe hypoglycemia should we think about it as having a benefit or just no detriment
81. well as other safety events with that being said we think we have achieved that but i will turn it over
82. rates are low with no increase in severe hypoglycemia i think to get a full understanding of the potential for hypoglycemia
83. pumps or not and can you remind us how to think about the mix of pumps versus multiple daily injections for
84. mitigate that risk so while we have low rates i think we can continue to work to reduce those rates as
85. inc evp corporate and administrative affairs and cfo 26 i think it s going to be pretty much somewhere between it
86. coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 34 but i think chris one of the things that s important and as
87. 1 patients is the incidence of euglycemic dka and i think you provided us with some measures in the past of
88. that we re not doing the insulin optimization so i think that you are we are going to expect to see
89. lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 54 yes yigal i think the design of that study as dr tyle has mentioned
90. has mentioned is to give us the exposure but i think we will have efficacy data to be able to show
91. that s the whole point of sitting down with i think our partners and having a good conversation sooner than later
92. to get clarity around those kinds of things but i think right now what we have shown is the tremendous benefit
93. results as well so i would say stay tuned i think sanofi is going to have a lot more to say
94. going to try to say it for them but i think they have a lot more to say in the very
95. and sat mass one last thing asking about insulin i think the evidence of optimization is a mean total daily insulin
96. good it shows adequate insulin for this population we often think of about 0 6 when we think about the insulin
97. population we often think of about 0 6 when we think about the insulin needs of some type 2 diabetes and
98. lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 73 i think we re going to look at the overall safety efficacy
99. of the cgm sub study as we go forward and think about what decisions we make with that dose and then
100. as well but 400 more of an effect so i think that all of those factors will be evaluated once we
101. have a complete data set in terms of how we think about the dose selection lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president
102. coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 74 yes i think the great news for us we know we have our
103. we know we have our minimally effective dose and i think that s great news with 200 we will be examining
104. s been very encouraging and has really inspired us i think the main thing that we hear is that patients see
105. with sotagliflozin it s like hills and valleys and i think what was really is most prominent is the reduction of
106. that i speak for many patients when i say i think it is so great that you can give fda this
107. how exciting this is for lexicon but more importantly i think kelly just closed out her commentary the best way for
108. patients and people living with type 1 diabetes and i think today we are closer to having impact in that regard
109. just celebrated our 20th anniversary as a company but i think this transaction has reared its head about once every two
110. questions please firstly interested in the timing i don t think anyone s really doubted the strategic logic of the potential
111. megabit per second broadband solution in their triple play i think because of their high triple play penetration their rgus as
112. about it s a little bit under 2 5 i think it s like 2 3 or 2 2 so their
113. obviously more than double in terms of our timing i think it s fair to say that we ve looked at
114. a decent quality with a little tlc and focus we think and clearly you can see there s massive penetration upside
115. of our further ambitions into wallonia or even brussels i think we ve been clearly stated that see ourselves as a
116. growing low double digit for the last few years we think we bring a lot of unique products and services and
117. leverage the b2b opportunity and there is some b2b i think very conservative b2b revenues in the synergy assumptions you want
118. strategy although the perception is that they are but i think their arpu is like i said a pretty strong triple
119. triple play penetration of their existing customer base so i think it s very manageable we do feel that ultimately we
120. fairly well with a slight premium to proximus so we think that over time we will it s very manageable i
121. john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 14 yes i think to get the synergies we are looking for over time
122. nv vp of strategic planning treasury and ir 18 i think also in addition to that as john mentioned earlier as
123. you have earmarked eur12 million investment in the capex i think john you mentioned maybe the fixed infrastructure wasn t compatible
124. recent investment plan for proximus for fiber rollout do you think it will have any impact on your b2b ambitions that
125. deal and the visibility on voo is low do you think there is a case over here in terms of increasing
126. telenet group holding nv ceo 27 but post synergies i think it s we re still i mean this isn t
127. they are thinking about the full year results but i think you can see that pro forma our leverage only goes
128. domestic market there is plenty of upside for us i think we always expect that we re competing with proximus fiber
129. a dominant share they ve got a 70 share i think of the total b2b market we wouldn t expect them
130. fairly dense penetration of flemish speaking households so when you think about just the fact that you are able to roll
131. them but they don t give anything away but i think there s massive precedent in europe for and in belgium
132. there s real political support for this transaction because i think they feel that this business in brussels hasn t quite
133. put its best foot forward to their expectations and they think it will be great for the city and for the
134. and it gives us the flexibility to do so i think of the probably total value of the tsa two thirds
135. macquarie research analyst 47 i just wanted to try and think forward on the direction of numbers and just wanted to
136. deal it would continue to decline so that when we think of the synergies in the longer term probably the best
137. the business is declining is that the right way to think of things john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 48
138. both in the b2c and the b2b markets and i think we ve been very conservative in terms of what we
139. see this as a two stage investment at all i think we would like to extend our footprint further but there
140. according to the diary the compliance was high let s think like that so we rather think it is due to
141. was high let s think like that so we rather think it is due to the variability in terms of absorption
142. bit of an over picture here that in fact i think if you go to auc or cmax variability probably is
143. really and a well designed study and i don t think anybody really wants to do the study so i think
144. think anybody really wants to do the study so i think the field is keeping track of what they observe and
145. will take all of that together so i don t think there is a study out there that really has mapped
146. saw piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific officer 14 i think if you will look back to the slides on our
147. pre kalydeco washout sweat chloride levels were i don t think we saw those in the slides today and that s
148. at the moment of the selection but i don t think there is a real other way when you want to
149. as one could expect from a naive patient and i think the most impressive sweat chloride drop that we ve seen
150. but okay then you have large pills that is i think for the level of efficacy we hope to bring to
151. out further and i don t know i don t think anybody knows the answer there whether you will be at
152. that at week four the levels are somewhat higher i think as well if you will look to the slides the
153. look to the slides the variability as well increase i think part of that is normal is the variability one by
154. to patients more specifically for their group as well i think that what we hear as well in the field the
155. the research for novel and more effective therapy and i think as well the quote of the investigator in our press
156. already piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific officer 43 i think if we now focus on triple combination there s going

35. of sotagliflozin in the study was excellent the proportion of patients with adverse events was similar between placebos sotagliflozin 200 and
36. similar in placebo sotagliflozin 200 milligrams and sotagliflozin 400 milligrams patients were treated safely it was not an issue for discontinuation
37. in a position that you need to put 200 more patients to really prove out that it is lower than 400
38. glucose monitoring data where we see the amount of time patients stay in the proper range however i can say that
39. to control it is the severe hypoglycemia that s why patients in this program had lived with type 1 diabetes for
40. do you know if the events in the study were patients who were on pumps or not and can you remind
41. consistently across multiple studies weight loss relative to placebo in patients treated with sotagliflozin and we frankly believe that that is
42. dka obviously one of the concerns with the type 1 patients is the incidence of euglycemic dka and i think you
43. provided us with some measures in the past of the patients who had dka but had glucoses less than 250 and
44. we have not dug that data deeper simply because these patients are already ongoing in this study so we have not
45. adverse events is there were two deaths on placebo these patients discontinued one died of lung cancer and one appeared to
46. we are going to expect to see a range of patients coming into the study that is in that same 7
47. do this as a real life study rather than in patients where we want to see the effectiveness of sotagliflozin after
48. trials has three components to it the three components are patients who will achieve an a1c below 7 at the end
49. will basically provide a numerical number a quantitative number for patients who have achieved benefits and with no safety adverse events
50. and i guess for intandem1 as well how were the patients with the dkas managed were they taken off the trial
51. on this to be up to the investigator and the patients as to whether or not they continue and if there
52. slide on dka on the 400 milligram dose but other patients stayed in the program and continued and they did well
53. evp and chief medical officer 65 yes it does as patients get into the program it s more common to increase
54. and is insulin optimization continuing in the intandem1 and intandem2 patients for the remainder of the follow up through 52 weeks
55. of some type 2 diabetes and we have evidence that patients are getting above that and we also have evidence that
56. a bunch of parameters it may also be the different patients would benefit from different doses and you mentioned that the
57. could talk a little bit about what the reactions of patients have been i mean people know people must know who
58. and we ve had some of their actions previously with patients who took sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes
59. i think the main thing that we hear is that patients see a better glucose profile throughout the day and one
60. the management of diabetes and that s the thing that patients have spoken to us most about it s been very
61. hypoglycemia and the two instruments together will cover concerns that patients have about hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia as well lonnel coats lexicon
62. and so we i know that i speak for many patients when i say i think it is so great that
63. the best way for us to end this is about patients this is about people living with type 1 diabetes and
64. how can we as an innovator improve the lives of patients and people living with type 1 diabetes and i think
65. from its saphira 1 phase 2 study in cystic fibrosis patients with potentiator glpg1837 call mechelen dec 21 2016 thomson streetevents
66. really set a standard for treatment of crohn s disease patients if we switch to cystic fibrosis we are very pleased
67. molecules individually upon healthy volunteers before we can go into patients and the first set of components are in these trials
68. that will address the major medical need amongst the cf patients to put together a triple combination we need one potentiator
69. timeline and our ambition is to bring a triple to patients by mid of next year and that critical timeline is
70. so for the triple combination we aim to bring in patients mid next year that is a combination of 2737 2222
71. portfolio we started a phase ii with 2222 recently in patients as well and you will see more data coming out
72. main goal is indeed to bring the best triple to patients and with that we hope to address both the heterozygous
73. heterozygous delta f508 or the heterozygous minus delta f508 cf patients which in total is about 80 of the cf patient
74. quite well served with the first drug and so most patients are on ivacaftor the second limitation is that it s
75. limitation is that it s ethically not acceptable to put patients on the placebo too long so we can it s
76. is fine for a study but you can t keep patients for longer on placebo so there is in this study
77. goes along the trial the trial was open both for patients that were on treatment with ivacaftor or never had treatment
78. with ivacaftor or never had treatment finally we included 26 patients on treatment and 25 of them were coming from their
79. new setting where we in fact included mainly treatment experienced patients it s very hard to compare the numbers as we
80. of years ago so within the setting of the study patients that were on treatment got a seven day washout and
81. that one month of treatment was again for the washout patients that were on treatment with ivacaftor returned to treatment so
82. s go to the next slide so in total 34 patients entered the study and were screened during the washout period
83. the study and were screened during the washout period eight patients stepped out of the study for different reasons some did
84. showing that indeed the washouts might have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of
85. the washouts might have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of them completed the
86. second phase the last two weeks we ve lost two patients that were on treatment one patient we dropped inaudible part
87. i ll come back to that later and so 24 patients completed the full study and i ll show you the
88. and i ll show you the data on these 24 patients next slide please so how comparable to other studies were
89. slide please so how comparable to other studies were the patients that entered the study as for the inaudible you will
90. split that up according to the different grades our two patients had percent predicted fev of less than 40 for those
91. big increase because it has been shown multiple times that patients with a low percent predicted fev have a hard time
92. an average three years so these are really treatment experienced patients and were on a very stable regimen and that as
93. fact lung function will improve or should improve compared to patients that have never seen a drug and which were published
94. in the in vitro cells where we use cells from patients and for g551d patients it s well know that you
95. cells where we use cells from patients and for g551d patients it s well know that you have to target the
96. the x axis you have the time so day 1 patients have not taken medications on the y axis we depict
97. clearly from this slide is that with the high dose patients as a group here exceeded our target concentration in the
98. liter and sweat chloride is an excellent biomarker in g551d patients so patients have the highest sweat chloride level of around
99. sweat chloride is an excellent biomarker in g551d patients so patients have the highest sweat chloride level of around 100 millimolar
100. is on the left we have the group of 15 patients which exceeded our target levels of day 29 and on
101. 29 and on the right a small group of six patients that did not exceed the target level after day 29
102. after day 29 so what you can see that those patients that did not exceed the target level of day 9
103. during the study on the left where you see the patients with the highest exposure now you can see in fact
104. here the screening fev which presents the mean of the patients on treatment and you ll see a drop of around
105. see that at the end of the study the 29 patients fully returned to the levels of percent predicted fev they
106. us impossible to compare these values with those obtained in patients that have never seen a treatment before on this graph
107. really were in this we had three ses in two patients so one patient showed an acute increase of non cardiac
108. to two facts either fev was further declining either the patients that have been washed out that had some more sputum
109. the first group that could perform a study in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the patients and the
110. in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the patients and the investigator in participating in the study and making
111. to bring forward triple therapies for all of the cf patients compound was safe and well tolerated we saw from week
112. the other hand side you know that the variability in patients typically is higher so we took some safety precautions i
113. but the margin there is quite limited and variability in patients is always going to be a bit higher than what
114. for example produced in its phase ii given that those patients were treatment naive is there results or any data out
115. notion that the washout isn t sufficient to return the patients to a naive baseline piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific
116. been published is on general with more incidental reports of patients that were off the drugged for a week two weeks
117. the clinic are you planning to test it in cf patients or just move on with the safety data piet wigerinck
118. triple for triple how do we move triple combination into patients so it s a mix of phase i and phase
119. should have two out of the three components tested in patients so 2222 is in phase i 1837 has been in
120. we have the time and principal to start testing in patients so it will be only one component 2737 which will
121. there is no adverse pk interaction and then move into patients with out of the triple combo 2737 will be the
122. at that moment is tested for the first time in patients i hope i make it clear not more confusing but
123. the how complex the way to our triple combo in patients currently debjit chattopadhyay janney montgomery scott analyst 11 and then
124. by the pulmonary function based on levels basically so those patients with less than 40 how did they respond i mean
125. how did they respond to your drug and then the patients who were really doing well on kalydeco how did they
126. patient efficacy because if we talk about inaudible about specific patients for the scientific conferences but we will clearly show up
127. by the way i just had a question the two patients that had the saes were they in the exposure above
128. will have in healthy volunteers about two weeks exposure in patients up to one month exposure we especially we ll have
129. way when you want to start to treat the cf patients you really want to give them as soon as possible
130. to be explored first in healthy volunteers and later in patients then the second question was the takeaway what was that
131. for the level of efficacy we hope to bring to patients acceptable but not optimal so that you at least have
132. after two weeks this is the first in treatment experienced patients that something we need to work out further and i
133. was much better when they entered the study compared to patients that had never seen a drug so there is a
134. of different studies difficult impact on 2451 therefore delta f508 patients in terms of triple combo is our main goal there
135. background but i can confirm here that for delta f508 patients there is no difference between 2451 and 1837 and was
136. questions only left please firstly did you monitor at all patients when they returned to kalydeco therapy so i guess was
137. so i guess was there any further gains in the patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients
138. gains in the patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients
139. patients did you notice anything when those patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients not followed during
140. patients the 25 patients returned back to the kalydeco where patients not followed during that period and then secondly just with
141. first question was on did we have off visit when patients returned to treatment yes we saw patients when they had
142. off visit when patients returned to treatment yes we saw patients when they had been on treatment back for about a
143. of days to a week between 3 and 10 days patients behaved are expected what i mean is there it s
144. 40 two from my side first i was wondering these patients that enrolled in the study they are actually on stable
145. because it gives me an opportunity again to thank the patients and investigators to participate in the study we ve been
146. up a worldwide impressive effort to improve the life of patients and what we heard from the patient that participated they
147. can contribute to bring novel drugs also for other cf patients that they are willing to participate there and that s
148. really motivated to in general bring more effective drugs to patients more specifically for their group as well i think that
149. desire to see competition there that s one and second patients really want to invest as well in the research for
150. we are on track to bring a triple combination to patients by mid of next year thank you stephanie vogt petercam
151. 2451 as well a combination there of healthy volunteers and patients so it s going to be mixed bag there and
152. test some of the components individual or in combination in patients we will start to do that that really gives us
153. that really gives us a lot of info on how patients what patients feel with this drug how they tolerate it
154. gives us a lot of info on how patients what patients feel with this drug how they tolerate it how variable
155. as we can prior to starting our triple cocktail in patients elizabeth goodwin galapagos nv vp ir amp corporate communications 44

12. the thing is spooling up and that is what is going to drive the ability to get the distribution to get
13. advantage and the execution and to make the flywheel keep going unidentified audience member 11 yes i guess for both of
14. we did that and i think that is we re going to see the benefits of that and for me as

16. china why is that is that going to be different going forward james quincey the coca cola company president coo 19
17. in china in the next few years it is not going to happen that way at least not organically and so
18. businesses and in the end just to round out by going back to japan as we think about our portfolio and
19. on china is that the whole digitization of china is going to make china look like a very different development curve
20. very different development curve in terms of where it is going compared to japan when it developed those categories there will
21. impossible time with 2017 so just wondering if you re going to help us anytime soon and then james just i
22. know it is a cheesy question but how are you going to define success during your tenure kathy waller the coca
23. is 10 years of success and a successor who is going to create another 10 years of success and so you
24. because i talk about the digitization of the business is going to be radically different over the next 10 years because
25. side of sparkling is and of course you re not going to have for a number of years big volume growth
26. need to do in terms of driving innovation we re going to be more pushy from the center on driving the
27. back once a year and tell me how it s going that was the model for 100 and something years so
28. look at the various components of it which one are going to be the key priorities james quincey the coca cola
29. into especially in the slightly weirder macro environment is it going to be a little more organic i don t see
30. the next 10 years will look i think it is going to be too volatile too much uncertainty we are going
31. going to be too volatile too much uncertainty we are going to need to be more fluid more adaptable yes the
32. to be more fluid more adaptable yes the corridors are going to remain the same yes the growth model of consumer
33. need to set ourselves some corridors that we think are going to be true and we re going to adapt and
34. we think are going to be true and we re going to adapt and they re going to change and trying
35. true and we re going to adapt and they re going to change and trying to prescribe exactly what that s
36. to change and trying to prescribe exactly what that s going to look like in the next 10 years is like
37. is like trying to say what is the next iphone going to be in 10 years time that s a bet
38. hard to make what we do know is digitization is going to change everything it is going to change the way
39. know is digitization is going to change everything it is going to change the way we interact with consumers it is
40. to change the way we interact with consumers it is going to change the way we interact with customers it is
41. to change the way we interact with customers it is going to change the way we operate the business exactly how
42. for the next year the next three years and bets going forward but i don t think we want to be
43. all the way out to the future so it s going to be a little more organic it s going to
44. s going to be a little more organic it s going to be a little more fluid because it needs to
45. times what it is today everyone in this room is going to be happy if it is the same number no
46. happy if it is the same number no one is going to be happy so the key thing is can we
47. coffee is your favorite brand because that s what s going to allow us to stay on the money with the
48. we are on track with consumers so it s all going to work together and that s what s going to
49. all going to work together and that s what s going to drive the top number and then the portfolio will

51. a great brand it is an interesting coffee we re going to put gold peak coffee out there as well and
52. interest and the value proposition with the customers that is going to get us to move forward so we think it
53. get us to move forward so we think it is going to be interesting and we re going to give it
54. think it is going to be interesting and we re going to give it a try kathy waller the coca cola
55. okay on the taxes i could have bet i was going to get that question tonight so thank you good news
56. that question tonight so thank you good news we are going to get everybody believes we now have a good shot
57. bad news is nobody has a clue what it is going to look like and so we obviously we have done
58. viewed the endovascular market is that not one device is going to be able to treat all aaa cases we do
59. that you may have with that being said i m going to turn the call over to dr lapuerta to walk
60. i think that s a very good question i m going to turn that one over to jeff jeff wade lexicon
61. have some great results here and i think we are going to line around the approach with the agency and that
62. liana moussatos wedbush securities analyst 9 okay and you are going to let the street know through a press release about
63. is consistent in this study as well so that s going to be something that we continue to learn from the
64. the incidence rate with pump use and that is just going to take some time for us to go through and
65. and administrative affairs and cfo 26 i think it s going to be pretty much somewhere between it s not going
66. going to be pretty much somewhere between it s not going to be close to either one of those it s
67. to be close to either one of those it s going to be pretty much in between jessica fye jpmorgan analyst
68. insulin optimization so i think that you are we are going to expect to see a range of patients coming into
69. 50 so one of the things yigal that you are going to hear us talk more about in the next few
70. what is your current thinking on whether the fda is going to want to convene any kind of advisory panel to
71. we can learn more about what sanofi how sanofi is going to approach that strategy lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president
72. so i would say stay tuned i think sanofi is going to have a lot more to say we re not
73. to have a lot more to say we re not going to try to say it for them but i think
74. analyst 72 understood and then just lastly just kind of going back to the dose selection conversation i guess i understand
75. pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 73 i think we re going to look at the overall safety efficacy across a bunch
76. from the other study on post prandial glucose we re going to want to see the glycemic variability data that we
77. that we are achieving is high quality a1c we re going to look at all the variables to make sure we
78. the variables to make sure we know that this is going to be and i have said this before what excites
79. said this before what excites me is that this is going to be the largest type 1 trial ever for an
80. give clear guidance and direction as we complete these trials going into the mid part of next year on all of
81. footprint mobile subs are in the sfr footprint which is going to support both our fixed line and our mobile business
82. do you see a path to further improving your footprint going forward into wallonia and the rest of brussels either on
83. that okay if you wait longer maybe the price is going to go down because it hasn t really been competing
84. footprint across the whole country but the next step is going to be multiple speakers paul sidney credit suisse analyst 4
85. trends for sfr and how do you see that evolving going forward and secondly is it correct to assume that you
86. telenet brand in terms of top line growth birgit is going to multiple speakers that one birgit conix telenet group holding
87. will be more in line with our own ebitda margins going forward once it s fully integrated john porter telenet group
88. flow and not base cash flow because it s not going to incrementally it will have higher margins than telenet s
89. it inaudible it will not really affect our overall margins going forward it will still impact up the road so it
90. but i wouldn t want to predict what they re going to do on terms of proximus s fiber rollout we
91. will have a much better idea of what it s going to take does that answer your question frank knowles new
92. have would be now plus synergies and obviously that s going to be lower because the business is declining is that
93. bit of upside in the revenue and that we re going to turn it around fairly quickly guy peddy macquarie research
94. you the topline results of the saphira 1 trial before going to the trial let me first explain to you where
95. designing the next trials and selecting doses that we re going to use in the triple combination so i want to
96. there is quite limited and variability in patients is always going to be a bit higher than what we ve seen
97. think if we now focus on triple combination there s going to be a combination of studies for the more advanced
98. combination there of healthy volunteers and patients so it s going to be mixed bag there and as soon as we

32. should we think about it as having a benefit or just no detriment lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo
33. jessica fye jpmorgan analyst 21 okay got it and maybe just one last one on dka do you know if the
34. i mean more on pumps than on multiple daily injection just generally in the program that is what is consistent in

36. pharmaceuticals inc evp r amp d 35 yes chris we just don t have this data collected and cleaned yet and
37. us with that similar update from the european study you just reported this morning lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and
38. 11 range that we ve had in two pivotal studies just without driving down the a1c before baseline alan carr needham
39. the question congrats on the results on intandem2 can you just clarify why you decided not to implement insulin optimization and
40. as 2017 unfolds yigal nochomovitz citigroup analyst 52 okay but just so i m i guess what i was driving at
41. so i m i guess what i was driving at just so i m clear it wouldn t be an unreasonable
42. look at the data from intandem2 which dr lapuerta reported just a few minutes ago the difference between baseline and screening
43. have those meetings yigal nochomovitz citigroup analyst 57 okay and just on the safety profile maybe dr lapuerta could just comment
44. and just on the safety profile maybe dr lapuerta could just comment in intandem2 and i guess for intandem1 as well
45. off the trial was there a dose reduction can you just clarify how that works thanks lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc
46. stifel nicolaus analyst 63 inaudible and congrats on the data just a quick question on the insulin optimization does that generally

48. presentations at ada from the data from this program but just not that duration data will be available in time to
49. conference stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst 72 understood and then just lastly just kind of going back to the dose selection
50. willey stifel nicolaus analyst 72 understood and then just lastly just kind of going back to the dose selection conversation i
51. so you might have spoken to this already but i just wanted to say congratulations type 1s have never really had
52. that will be easy for their positions and i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what
53. meal and you have a big spike in glucose to just a reasonable hill where there is only a modest elevation
54. for all who have called in this morning i will just close again by saying how exciting this is for lexicon

68. michael bishop goldman sachs michael bishop goldman sachs analyst 32 just firstly on content is there much incremental investment you ll
69. sell that content into the new footprint and then secondly just to follow up on the margin question so if i
70. we also did with the base acquisition earlier this year just to make sure that we don t i mention an
71. penetration of flemish speaking households so when you think about just the fact that you are able to roll out your
72. goldman sachs analyst 36 yes that s great guys and just maybe quickly just on regulation you mentioned in the release
73. 36 yes that s great guys and just maybe quickly just on regulation you mentioned in the release you don t
74. you don t expect any real issues so i was just wondering whether you ve had preliminary talks with the local
75. talks with the local regulators already or whether that s just an expectation john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 37
76. i missed the first 10 minutes or so could you just in the i gather that altice has said they will

81. putting into the mobile network and the fact that we just did a field test of lte advanced or 4 5
82. thanks for taking my questions i guess first question is just on the plasma exposure you showed pretty big difference in
83. company analyst 6 and then last question from me is just on the prior exposure to kalydeco you mentioned several times
84. are you planning to test it in cf patients or just move on with the safety data piet wigerinck galapagos nv
85. and the intervals look the same too but i m just wondering if you can give us a little bit more
86. stanley analyst 19 this is vikram on for matthew so just one quick question from our side would you be able

8. affairs and cfo 10 i think as we get additional data from the program it will also give us the opportunity
9. in terms of our strategy so we will have additional data in 2017 from this program and there will be some
10. thoughts on 200 versus 400 when i look at this data it looks like 200 is clearly more tolerable or safe
11. kind of stuff but you are generating all the safety data at 400 it s to the extent that 200 ends
12. a possibility that you would need to generate more safety data at that dose or are you kind of covered because
13. be that we would be covered because we have safety data at the higher dose we re obviously very pleased with
14. with these two doses we also want to see the data relating to time and range and other key secondary endpoints
15. want to move forward with the 400 acknowledging that that data will exist will you then be in a position that
16. be very helpful for us to have continuous glucose monitoring data where we see the amount of time patients stay in
17. re looking forward to learning more from continuous glucose monitoring data which we will report out later but we are pleased
18. to be something that we continue to learn from the data about what can we do to mitigate that but it
19. and company analyst 31 thanks very much congratulations on the data updates can you talk to us a little bit about
20. if not yet when we can expect to see that data lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 32 i
21. as we ve gone along we don t have the data from the pivotal studies but we have shown consistently across
22. d 35 yes chris we just don t have this data collected and cleaned yet and that study is not reporting
23. r amp d 38 chris we have not dug that data deeper simply because these patients are already ongoing in this
24. of doing intandem3 study is really to collect more safety data actually our primary endpoint is not even reduction of a1c
25. r amp d 53 well if you look at the data from intandem2 which dr lapuerta reported just a few minutes
26. us the exposure but i think we will have efficacy data to be able to show in a real world setting
27. to convene any kind of advisory panel to discuss the data next year or i guess in 2018 lonnel coats lexicon
28. willey stifel nicolaus analyst 63 inaudible and congrats on the data just a quick question on the insulin optimization does that
29. stifel nicolaus analyst 68 okay and then the sub study data the cgm and sat mass is that being collected through
30. okay and then you have previously insinuated that the complete data from these two pivotals could be most likely presented i
31. wondering if we should expect to see the sub study data as part of that presentation and i m presuming that
32. m presuming that you will have 52 week follow up data from at least intandem1 at that point is there a
33. ceo 71 actually steve the deadlines for submitting that duration data don t really we don t have time to do
34. will be cut off before we would have the full data we may actually have some of that data sort of
35. the full data we may actually have some of that data sort of midyear but we wouldn t have the opportunity
36. wouldn t have the opportunity to present the 52 week data at ada it would end up being a later scientific
37. do expect to have some presentations at ada from the data from this program but just not that duration data will
38. the data from this program but just not that duration data will be available in time to the conference stephen willey
39. context of it but if you look at the intandem4 data and you see that the 400 milligrams is essentially giving
40. we re going to want to see the glycemic variability data that we are generating as part of the cgm sub
41. those factors will be evaluated once we have a complete data set in terms of how we think about the dose
42. ever for an oral antidiabetic agent we will have more data than anybody else and we will be able to give
43. it and determine how we go forward based on that data and what s the optimal opportunity for us to approach
44. believe you had asked about the cgm and body mass data i want to confirm what pablo was saying earlier which
45. confirm what pablo was saying earlier which is the cgm data is up to 24 weeks but the body mass data
46. data is up to 24 weeks but the body mass data and bone density data we are collecting up to 52
47. 24 weeks but the body mass data and bone density data we are collecting up to 52 weeks that s why
48. are collecting up to 52 weeks that s why the data won t be available until the end of the study

50. or maybe q4 that you could present the longer term data lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 79 liana
51. so once we have aligned around now we have these data and have those conversations we will align around strategically where
52. align around strategically where we would start to put our data those conversations are ongoing and we will finalize them so
53. also if they if any of them have seen the data the cgm data 2 5 hours more in the zone
54. if any of them have seen the data the cgm data 2 5 hours more in the zone is really meaningful
55. in the zone is really meaningful that was from the data that you shared with us on the last trial and
56. don t know if you talked about the timing zone data on today s news yet so thank you very much
57. we have not talked about the time and the range data for these trials because we are collecting all of that
58. for these trials because we are collecting all of that data and we will report that out data but from a

61. it is so great that you can give fda this data and get us beyond thinking about only a1c so thank

63. advanced or 4 5 network at over 1 gig of data speeds off of a wireless network the idea of mobile
64. ceo 3 thank you elizabeth before piet will discuss the data on 1837 i thought it would be a good moment
65. scientific conferences and the most important one was the endoscopic data that were reported out of the crohn s disease trial

70. recently in patients as well and you will see more data coming out of phase is and phase iis next year
71. completed the full study and i ll show you the data on these 24 patients next slide please so how comparable
72. see a nice dose response based on our in vitro data next slide please let s first start with exposure so
73. this brings me to the conclusions on the saphira 1 data and the conclusions on 1837 we are very proud in
74. phil nadeau cowen amp company analyst 2 congratulations on the data thanks for taking my questions i guess first question is
75. times during the presentation that you can t compare these data to the data that kalydeco for example produced in its
76. presentation that you can t compare these data to the data that kalydeco for example produced in its phase ii given
77. those patients were treatment naive is there results or any data out there to suggest that there is a change of
78. in cf patients or just move on with the safety data piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific officer 10 okay thank
79. then 1837 is in the game we have more advanced data we exactly know the dose even under the saphira 1
80. up to the moment that we want to have 2737 data and two have discussed this with the partner abbvie was
81. it s a mix of phase i and phase ii data and by phase i data i mean the healthy volunteers
82. phase i and phase ii data and by phase i data i mean the healthy volunteers so by mid of next
83. ii i mean it s linked to the phase ii data coming out next year piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific
84. on the slides we tried to keep the overflow of data comprehensive and did not include that to keep all of
85. here the complexity of the cf between the three all data points can be driven by the mutational background but i
86. levels at day 29 that group showed from the first data point onwards lower levels and you see at every time
87. really appreciate all the interest that people have in our data if there are folks who are not able to ask

6. time of the year before and it is a good time to get together i want all of you to know
7. to our business if we can do that in the time frame i have got several colleagues here associates and colleagues
8. question of why now because this is definitely the right time i believe and i think in the end the single
9. and a long term work and so this is the time that i believe that is the right time to hand
10. is the time that i believe that is the right time to hand the responsibilities and the keys to someone that
11. to address and answer your questions at this very exciting time for our enterprise and for the future of our system
12. and that s why i decided this was the best time and there was no better time when you look at
13. this was the best time and there was no better time when you look at the world of agriculture which we
14. more lemon trees under plantation there is only one best time when you decide when to harvest and that was the

22. exceeding some of the emerging markets now i think over time the equilibrium will start playing but i would i am
23. been massively successful in that you need innovation all the time but it has been harder for you to do that
24. and i did a deal with robert kuok at that time to buy that business back from him back seven eight
25. bottler in china because everything was so new at that time and it was opening up so that is the why
26. of japan and each one starts to layer on over time and takes a good number of years to develop so
27. but we have to focus on building that business over time in the same way we did in japan now clearly
28. landscape is slightly different in china and the amount of time available is slightly different so the plan won t look
29. want a modeling call because i m having an impossible time with 2017 so just wondering if you re going to
30. will be something radically different about our business by the time i leave and hopefully it will be a long multi
31. the us business back to growth but at the same time we changed the perpetual contract that was something that was
32. of years before it just took this takes a long time because of the architecture that you have to create to
33. wrong james would have the same problem in three years time so it is in a way frustrating but it just
34. a way frustrating but it just took the amount of time so from my perspective that and then also i wish
35. now in the world because the consumer for the first time in years teen incidence for brand coke is growing in
36. the coca cola company president coo 35 certainly by the time we get to 2020 we will have refreshed the vision
37. is the next iphone going to be in 10 years time that s a bet that is too hard to make
38. were no immediate or delayed access related complications and deployment time was 19 to 45 minutes which is significantly lower than
39. position to sell profitability in brazil it also takes some time to help with reducing the manufacturing costs so we feel
40. 20 range for those western countries but it takes some time to get to that point it s not on day
41. and i will be your conference operator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the lexicon pharmaceuticals
42. diabetes on average for 18 years for that amount of time they still had not been able to overcome the limitations
43. point is to have those have that dialogue during the time that we are wrapping up the phase 3 program and
44. benefit 400 is really adding particularly without more information on time and target glucose range and that kind of stuff but
45. doses we also want to see the data relating to time and range and other key secondary endpoints so clearly the
46. continuous glucose monitoring data where we see the amount of time patients stay in the proper range however i can say
47. pump use and that is just going to take some time for us to go through and catalog every patient to
48. that duration data don t really we don t have time to do that with ada because the deadlines will be
49. but just not that duration data will be available in time to the conference stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst 72 understood
50. 83 thank you kelly we have not talked about the time and the range data for these trials because we are
51. you very much for your commentary operator 92 at this time there are no further questions in queue lonnel coats lexicon
52. and luxembourg today s conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the call over to mr
53. been able to join this call despite the relatively short time frame i trust you all received our press release this
54. so plenty of upside in the footprint at the same time we will become active in 60 new municipalities in brussels
55. become active outside of our home country for the first time through sfr s luxembourg based operations more importantly we are
56. 24 to revenue in addition we will also incur one time integration costs of around eur4 million we intend to finance
57. the numbers that we presented that this is the right time to do the transaction and also because the scope of
58. a slight premium to proximus so we think that over time we will it s very manageable i don t know
59. think to get the synergies we are looking for over time we will definitely be introducing the telenet brand the telenet
60. you will be making to altice for those services over time thank you john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 41
61. agreement which we are quite comfortable that we have enough time to do the things that we need to do a
62. consider rolling out your own network in wallonia and what time frame would you give yourself to consider that thank you
63. and welcome to the galapagos webcast conference call at this time i would like to turn the conference over to elizabeth
64. the design of saphira 1 and let s spend some time here because it s a special design we have to
65. patients with a low percent predicted fev have a hard time showing any improvement and then i ve given as well
66. with exposure so on the x axis you have the time so day 1 patients have not taken medications on the
67. 100 millimolar per liter and what we see is with time and by design as well on the slide by dose
68. and exposure we see a nice drop of sweat over time in the study so sweat chloride is an important parameter
69. fev1 we use again the same x axis which is time have added here the screening fev which presents the mean
70. from day 8 onwards a stable and steady increase with time of the percent predicted fev important to note as well
71. mean but giving the idea that it takes much more time more than the sweat to really get to a maximal
72. 1 as well was important because it s the first time we validate our in vitro assays and so this really
73. explain during the portfolio slide it was more driven currently time wise then by 2737 and as i pointed out as
74. i by that moment 2451 as well we have the time and principal to start testing in patients so it will
75. only component at that moment is tested for the first time in patients i hope i make it clear not more
76. see that the mean of this group really goes with time and those we have convinced them there must be a
77. that to keep all of the graphs in the complex time exposure and sweat a little bit simple on kalydeco the
78. will be longer but it s clear that for the time limiting component 2737 exposure will be limited at the moment
79. placebo and with the fact that this is the first time in treatment experienced patient is two week sufficient i know
80. normal is the variability one by the smaller numbers to time it takes when the variability is highest honestly because it
81. data point onwards lower levels and you see at every time point that that group is low so that s clearly
82. ve been waiting for disease modifying drugs for a long time they ve set up a worldwide impressive effort to improve
83. are very pleased at this study we could recruit in time we could accomplish in time and as we said we
84. study we could recruit in time we could accomplish in time and as we said we have an extremely busy year
85. to jump in now because we ve run out of time and i really appreciate all the interest that people have

1. versus placebo on optimized insulin intandem3 is a large safety study it s ongoing and we ll provide results in the
2. of sotagliflozin all on top of optimized insulin therapy the study was double blind it does include some studies which we
3. population is one with type 1 diabetes patients entered the study either using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections they were
4. and triglyceride less than 600 the next slide has the study outline there was a screening period of two weeks followed
5. weeks which is very important to the execution of this study afterwards patients went on 24 weeks randomized either placebo 200
6. 24 week primary endpoint patients continued double blinded in the study and they will receive up to 28 weeks more of
7. treatment for a total of 52 weeks there so the study is still ongoing next slide optimized insulin therapy is a
8. optimized insulin therapy is a very important element of the study design it s a rigorous six week program the objective
9. and assurance that insulin has been optimized continues throughout the study period reviewed by a committee of independent experts providing feedback
10. the mean baseline a1c is less than 8 in its study at baseline it s between 7 7 and 7 8
11. these results fully replicate the results of our first pivotal study intandem1 there was no significant reduction in a1c during the
12. the adverse event profile the safety of sotagliflozin in the study was excellent the proportion of patients with adverse events was
13. half of next year or so and the third safety study is we would have data from the middle of next
14. secondary endpoints so clearly the 200 milligram dose in this study as in the intandem1 performed very well on both safety
15. we re really trying to do with the additional safety study is to get additional safety exposure broadly and i think
16. exposure broadly and i think we will have that that study will succeed in that effort jessica fye jpmorgan analyst 18
17. could not overcome the limitations of insulin and in this study they made important progress in doing that without severe hypoglycemia
18. on dka do you know if the events in the study were patients who were on pumps or not and can
19. of pumps versus multiple daily injections for the larger safety study lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 22 i
20. in the program that is what is consistent in this study as well so that s going to be something that
21. the intandem3 so the intandem1 was a us mostly us study north american study and had about 60 pumps 40 multiple
22. the intandem1 was a us mostly us study north american study and had about 60 pumps 40 multiple daily injections this
23. and had about 60 pumps 40 multiple daily injections this study had about 25 pumps but 75 multiple daily injections intandem3
24. pumps but 75 multiple daily injections intandem3 is a global study so it has sites in north america and in europe
25. some of the other secondary endpoints either from this european study or what you know so far from the us study
26. study or what you know so far from the us study that you reported almost three months ago now in particular
27. goal is to report that at the end of the study after the 52 week period so sometime towards the middle
28. t have this data collected and cleaned yet and that study is not reporting yet chris shibutani cowen and company analyst
29. perhaps provide us with that similar update from the european study you just reported this morning lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc
30. deeper simply because these patients are already ongoing in this study so we have not unblinded that portion of the database
31. expect to see a range of patients coming into the study that is in that same 7 to 11 range that
32. also given that that is how you are doing the study are you expecting to see larger a1c drops with sotagliflozin
33. is praveen you know the primary goal of doing intandem3 study is really to collect more safety data actually our primary
34. have discussed earlier the reason we are doing this safety study is to comply with the ich guidance in terms of
35. and we want to do this as a real life study rather than in patients where we want to see the
36. has been optimized so this will provide really real life study for safety purposes and it is more or less for
37. achieve an a1c below 7 at the end of the study with no dka and no severe hypoglycemia so it will
38. than the bottom line between baseline and end of the study lonnel coats lexicon pharmaceuticals inc president and ceo 54 yes
39. ceo 54 yes yigal i think the design of that study as dr tyle has mentioned is to give us the
40. willey stifel nicolaus analyst 68 okay and then the sub study data the cgm and sat mass is that being collected
41. just wondering if we should expect to see the sub study data as part of that presentation and i m presuming
42. doses and you mentioned that the effect from the other study on post prandial glucose we re going to want to
43. that we are generating as part of the cgm sub study as we go forward and think about what decisions we
44. data won t be available until the end of the study stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst 76 understood thanks for taking
45. nv reports topline results from its saphira 1 phase 2 study in cystic fibrosis patients with potentiator glpg1837 call mechelen dec
46. and seven days of placebo treatment is fine for a study but you can t keep patients for longer on placebo
47. patients for longer on placebo so there is in this study not a placebo group which goes along the trial the
48. so there was only one naive patient included in the study endpoints were safety and tolerability and the secondary endpoints were
49. couple of years ago so within the setting of the study patients that were on treatment got a seven day washout
50. the next slide so in total 34 patients entered the study and were screened during the washout period eight patients stepped
51. during the washout period eight patients stepped out of the study for different reasons some did not meet inclusion or exclusion
52. have some impact on patients so 26 patients entered the study on treatment all of them completed the treatment on the
53. on treatment one patient we dropped inaudible part of the study and one patient was taken out because of creatine phosphokinase
54. to that later and so 24 patients completed the full study and i ll show you the data on these 24
55. comparable to other studies were the patients that entered the study as for the inaudible you will see that the baseline
56. the population we expected and hoped to see in the study next slide please so how did we select the dosages
57. as a group here exceeded our target concentration in the study what you can see as well is the exposure to
58. see a nice drop of sweat over time in the study so sweat chloride is an important parameter because it s
59. of day 9 had clearly lower exposures during the whole study and as a consequence as well they show a lower
60. well they show a lower sweat chloride drop during the study on the left where you see the patients with the
61. very pleased to see that at the end of the study the 29 patients fully returned to the levels of percent
62. with an effective drug so clearly showing that in the study 1837 was able to show an effect of percent predicted
63. non cardiac creatine phosphokinase and was taken out of the study we don t know very well what happened there it
64. will have to watch and as well we need to study whether there is some frequency or what the exact frequency
65. exacerbation a pulmonary exacerbation on the last day of the study so this patient was for the pulmonary exacerbation taken up
66. was a very low incidence of respiratory events in the study so overall the drug as we started the slide was
67. that we were the first group that could perform a study in g551d patients we want to especially thank both the
68. both the patients and the investigator in participating in the study and making this possible this really illustrates the desire of
69. to see that fev levels at the end of the study were at the same level as they were on a
70. on the spread of plasma exposures the patient in the study had a diary and according to the diary the compliance
71. a week two weeks 28 days but not a systematic study that shows when and especially fev and pulmonary exacerbations have
72. s more incidental reporting and really and a well designed study and i don t think anybody really wants to do
73. i don t think anybody really wants to do the study so i think the field is keeping track of what
74. that together so i don t think there is a study out there that really has mapped that out operator 8
75. i believe that the pulmonary exacerbation did well in the study and we were very also the patient of course was
76. moment to take the patient off and out of the study and that s it katherine xu william blair analyst 27
77. the for 2222 in fact we have a three month study ongoing so there the exposure will be longer but it
78. impressive sweat chloride drop that we ve seen in the study so was really in naive naive and showed an increase
79. of patient probably was much better when they entered the study compared to patients that had never seen a drug so
80. was already beginning to plateau at the end of the study and equally in the other group it looks as though
81. at where it was when they entered screening of the study then about the group that reached a target exposure at
82. first i was wondering these patients that enrolled in the study they are actually on stable treatment what is the main
83. to thank the patients and investigators to participate in the study we ve been pleasantly surprised that really this cf field
84. clearly hints to that so timelines for triple with this study well we can confirm anything like that so we are
85. anything like that so we are very pleased at this study we could recruit in time we could accomplish in time

12. will coca cola company will be out of the bottling business there completely correct muhtar kent the coca cola company chairman
13. i should start with why we got into the bottling business simply because the kuok family wanted out because they were
14. deal with robert kuok at that time to buy that business back from him back seven eight years ago i think
15. and then also to get the bottlers into the stills business we had to be involved in china that s how

59. t miss a beat integrating this business into telenet s business into the new telenet group business in terms of our
60. business into telenet s business into the new telenet group business in terms of our further ambitions into wallonia or even
61. then the triple play on the b2b with being the business operated in the brussels region do you see more b2b
62. is very very underserved by the cable companies our b2b business has been growing low double digit for the last few
63. margins that you have in terms of your underlying cable business is it aligned with the margins that you have and
64. i mean this isn t really incremental to our core business so you have to look at it as incremental cash
65. incrementally it will have higher margins than telenet s overall business birgit conix telenet group holding nv cfo 28 correct but
66. project called nexus which is tentatively a fiber rollout in business parks primarily in flanders up till now but we can
67. competitor in b2b they are very good at any enterprise business that s why they have such a dominant share they
68. of fiber but we can still win a lot of business and we do in the fluxion of the market we
69. for this transaction because i think they feel that this business in brussels hasn t quite put its best foot forward
70. it support and once we get our hands around the business we will have a much better idea of what it
71. that actually this asset you are buying is a declining business so pre the deal it would continue to decline so
72. and obviously that s going to be lower because the business is declining is that the right way to think of

15. not in 2017 only but 2017 2018 2019 2020 and years ahead and i am fully confident that is going to
16. lot of if you compare that to the previous 129 years of our history all of what s happened in the
17. there something in his resume over the past five 10 years that he really did well or was there something you
18. you are particularly some challenge in the past five 10 years that boy it was such a challenge and we overcame
19. the whole body of work over the past say 20 years muhtar kent the coca cola company chairman ceo 12 james
20. elevated after he ran mexico successfully for a number of years and amongst those group presidents are those who basically trying
21. and i have followed his career over the last 10 years since i came back to the company 10 of the
22. i came back to the company 10 of the 12 years very closely and i decided yes this is the person
23. the united states our flagship market we had eight nine years ago our stills portfolio was 7 of the total of
24. exit and how you think the next five to 10 years will look in china which has proven to be an
25. to buy that business back from him back seven eight years ago i think it was so that was the why
26. japan japan first of all was not developed in 10 years and secondly wasn t born as a five category business
27. one category and then it became two and then 10 years later or 20 years later it became three and four
28. it became two and then 10 years later or 20 years later it became three and four and five and actually
29. layer on over time and takes a good number of years to develop so we should not have the expectation that
30. we can create japan in china in the next few years it is not going to happen that way at least
31. sparkling business it actually was 90 plus sparkling 10 15 years ago and it is now down towards the 70 s
32. look in a way success is a repeat in x years let s say 10 for the sake of the argument
33. to stand here and say my greatest legacy is 10 years of success and a successor who is going to create
34. and a successor who is going to create another 10 years of success and so you have to get as said
35. is going to be radically different over the next 10 years because effectively when muhtar started the iphone didn t exist
36. share about something you have missed for the last eight years or you should have you think you could have done
37. business cce was kind of a degenerative model over 30 years and it could not it just was not sustainable from
38. would have liked to get there just a couple of years before it just took this takes a long time because
39. those wrong james would have the same problem in three years time so it is in a way frustrating but it
40. was we were in arizona with all the bottlers three years ago and we visited stores and then we got together
41. the world because the consumer for the first time in years teen incidence for brand coke is growing in the united
42. you re not going to have for a number of years big volume growth when you are downsizing it is just
43. s going that was the model for 100 and something years so it was very entrepreneurial and very decentralized and so
44. have been on a journey for the last number of years to not lose that entrepreneurialship but leverage it when we
45. zero moved so fast across our system back six seven years ago and it was first launched in a white label
46. kind of circuit diagram way is how the next 10 years will look i think it is going to be too
47. that s going to look like in the next 10 years is like trying to say what is the next iphone
48. what is the next iphone going to be in 10 years time that s a bet that is too hard to
49. have got ideas for the next year the next three years and bets going forward but i don t think we
50. we moved dunkin to korea multiple speakers four or five years ago james quincey the coca cola company president coo 46
51. ceo 47 i mean georgia to korea four or five years ago and it has done great multiple speakers it is
52. seven new board members over the last four or five years four years actually less than four years and that will
53. board members over the last four or five years four years actually less than four years and that will continue and
54. four or five years four years actually less than four years and that will continue and certainly my role i see
55. in kind the term of the convertible bond is five years with a conversion price of 0 90 per share representing
56. predictions of poor outcomes the performance of aorfix after five years is very similar to that of competitor devices in normal
57. and so it will be at least a couple of years before we ll be in a position to sell profitability

19. steve the deadlines for submitting that duration data don t really we don t have time to do that with ada
20. i just wanted to say congratulations type 1s have never really had anything that s easy to take to add to
21. cgm data 2 5 hours more in the zone is really meaningful that was from the data that you shared with
22. been very positive it s been very encouraging and has really inspired us i think the main thing that we hear
23. s like hills and valleys and i think what was really is most prominent is the reduction of these mountains to
24. interested in the timing i don t think anyone s really doubted the strategic logic of the potential deal but can
25. price is going to go down because it hasn t really been competing that successfully with proximus in its core region
26. one is price and the other is quality so you really don t want the asset to diminish in quality to
27. nv ceo 10 yes they re not they haven t really gone to market with a fresh challenge or strategy although
28. it s we re still i mean this isn t really incremental to our core business so you have to look
29. but given the size of it inaudible it will not really affect our overall margins going forward it will still impact
30. nv ceo 34 and on the programming costs it s really around the margins there s not a lot of negative
31. driven in terms of strategic upside et cetera so nothing really that matters on the tax side so no john porter
32. publicity and a lot of compliments because the data set really set a standard for treatment of crohn s disease patients
33. on treatment for an average three years so these are really treatment experienced patients and were on a very stable regimen
34. target the opening of the channel 24 7 so we really have taken dosages that would give us sufficiently high pre
35. level and then the high group the 500 milligram bid really was on the target of our exposure and for that
36. s a very specific biomarker that shows that your drug really binds to the cftr and keeps the cftr open and
37. it takes much more time more than the sweat to really get to a maximal of fev so in fact we
38. generally well tolerated so we had few adverse events that really were in this we had three ses in two patients
39. increases have been mentioned before and we ve to see really what happened here we did some investigations and can t
40. in participating in the study and making this possible this really illustrates the desire of the field to have more than
41. time we validate our in vitro assays and so this really helps us in designing the next trials and selecting doses
42. as well if you work with a potentiator because we really need to open that channel 24 7 phil nadeau cowen
43. taking away medication but that s more incidental reporting and really and a well designed study and i don t think
44. a well designed study and i don t think anybody really wants to do the study so i think the field
45. don t think there is a study out there that really has mapped that out operator 8 debjit chattopadhyay janney debjit
46. respond to your drug and then the patients who were really doing well on kalydeco how did they come back because
47. much higher so that makes it more difficult to correlate really on individual level exposures to fev on the other hand
48. hand if you see that the mean of this group really goes with time and those we have convinced them there
49. increase or exposure increases you might see more so it really it was a very it was a spike of a
50. you want to start to treat the cf patients you really want to give them as soon as possible as well
51. drop that we ve seen in the study so was really in naive naive and showed an increase in fev as
52. was probably for the scientific conferences but he or she really behaved as one would expect a naive patient would behave
53. in terms of maximal efficacy between 2451 and 1837 so really don t see any difference there we don t see
54. participate in the study we ve been pleasantly surprised that really this cf field is an extremely motivated field don t
55. and what we heard from the patient that participated they really want to give something back to the field as well
56. give something back to the field as well and they really hope and are motivated if they can contribute to bring
57. there is not too much in here but they are really motivated to in general bring more effective drugs to patients
58. what we hear as well in the field the field really would appreciate to have a choice between two or more
59. to see competition there that s one and second patients really want to invest as well in the research for novel
60. combination in patients we will start to do that that really gives us a lot of info on how patients what

27. versus 400 when i look at this data it looks like 200 is clearly more tolerable or safe from a dka
28. it s to the extent that 200 ends up looking like the most viable dose is there a possibility that you
29. bit of comparing your cross studies here but it looked like in intandem1 acting both arms had a lower rate of
30. relative to placebo which is pretty encouraging here it looks like it may be a little bit more of a wash
31. pump use jessica fye jpmorgan analyst 25 yes that seems like a pretty easy to identify population i guess based on
32. the net benefit which has the component of a1c so like we have discussed earlier the reason we are doing this
33. throughout the day and after meals and between meals was like mountains and canyons he said now with sotagliflozin it s
34. mountains and canyons he said now with sotagliflozin it s like hills and valleys and i think what was really is
35. s conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the call over to mr rob goyens please
36. for us the strategic rationale is pretty straightforward nothing succeeds like buying the cable system next door at that s exactly
37. a little bit under 2 5 i think it s like 2 3 or 2 2 so their rgus would be
38. a telenet but it is not a poor quality network like i said there are a lot of indications that it
39. at the right price voo is much more complex but like i ve said before we continue to stay close to
40. a so we will see where that all goes and like i said our ambition is to essentially have a quad
41. then the costs to give you some examples based on like marketing it s one brand also backbone integration not consolidation
42. is that they are but i think their arpu is like i said a pretty strong triple play penetration of their
43. on an accounting basis there s no further adjustment required like it was the case in base secondly on the recent
44. in those areas also on the entertainment side it seems like an incremental upside michael bishop goldman sachs analyst 36 yes
45. a two stage investment at all i think we would like to extend our footprint further but there are a lot
46. are a lot of different options available to us so like i said other than acquiring voo which is not for

53. corporate communications 5 thank you very much piet i would like to invite the operator now to connect us to any
54. to the diary the compliance was high let s think like that so we rather think it is due to the
55. variability what is your thought on dosing do you feel like the 500 milligram bid dose therefore is the practice or
56. we would go to a 600 milligram bid or anything like that but the margin there is quite limited and variability
57. of responses of a patient depending on exposure to kalydeco like has that been shown for kalydeco that somebody who has
58. the dose selection and especially the max limitation is based like any studies on the total behavior in preclinical species what
59. for triple with this study well we can confirm anything like that so we are very pleased at this study we
60. be a combination of studies for the more advanced components like 2222 it s clearly the phase ii exploration for 2737

23. earlier than what you were expected thanks birgit conix telenet group holding nv cfo 26 firstly on the margins so the
24. going forward once it s fully integrated john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 27 but post synergies i think it
25. higher margins than telenet s overall business birgit conix telenet group holding nv cfo 28 correct but given the size of

39. placebo so there is in this study not a placebo group which goes along the trial the trial was open both
40. so the x axis is the concentration so the lower group was predicted to show minimal efficacy the mid group of
41. lower group was predicted to show minimal efficacy the mid group of 250 would come close but little bit below our
42. little bit below our target level and then the high group the 500 milligram bid really was on the target of
43. was on the target of our exposure and for that group we expected the best results which clearly we were hoping
44. slide is that with the high dose patients as a group here exceeded our target concentration in the study what you
45. exposure so meaning that the variability is limited in that group if you now on the next slide use the same
46. dose was around 32 millimolar as a mean over the group next slide please because we did some more work on
47. we have now is on the left we have the group of 15 patients which exceeded our target levels of day
48. levels of day 29 and on the right a small group of six patients that did not exceed the target level
49. are very proud in fact that we were the first group that could perform a study in g551d patients we want
50. other hand if you see that the mean of this group really goes with time and those we have convinced them
51. guess i mean it looks as though that in the group that had above target exposure the exposure continues to increase
52. the end of the study and equally in the other group it looks as though the drug considerations dropped to even
53. be seeing that in that i know a relatively small group thank you onno van de stolpe galapagos nv ceo 38
54. better a few do a little bit worse as a group it s stable so it s not that as a
55. it s stable so it s not that as a group that we clearly see difference there but we have to
56. when they entered screening of the study then about the group that reached a target exposure at day 29 high increase
57. should have the same outcome at day 29 then the group that did not reach target levels at day 29 that
58. that did not reach target levels at day 29 that group showed from the first data point onwards lower levels and
59. levels and you see at every time point that that group is low so that s clearly variability there that we
60. bring more effective drugs to patients more specifically for their group as well i think that what we hear as well

12. at the price that we paid it is not a telenet but it is not a poor quality network like i
13. this thing is not huge it represents about 4 of telenet s installed base so we re pretty confident that we
14. we won t miss a beat integrating this business into telenet s business into the new telenet group business in terms
15. integrating this business into telenet s business into the new telenet group business in terms of our further ambitions into wallonia
16. you see more b2b potential than your average within the telenet scope and did they already serve some of the small

30. in the cost synergies of the sfr deal john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 17 we don t have it

32. on a solution for the customers in brussels rob goyens telenet group holding nv vp of strategic planning treasury and ir
33. mentioned maybe the fixed infrastructure wasn t compatible to the telenet network now does this investment include the level of quality

37. not going to incrementally it will have higher margins than telenet s overall business birgit conix telenet group holding nv cfo
38. have higher margins than telenet s overall business birgit conix telenet group holding nv cfo 28 correct but given the size
39. road so it s exactly be on plan john porter telenet group holding nv ceo 29 on the shareholder remuneration question

25. dose bid on day 15 again we take the pre dose value before they escalate thus you can see day 22
26. so clearly from this slide is that with the high dose patients as a group here exceeded our target concentration in
27. time and by design as well on the slide by dose and exposure we see a nice drop of sweat over
28. cftr and keeps the cftr open and by showing here dose dependent decrease of sweat we show that the drug in

32. this design the maximal drop in sweat of the high dose was around 32 millimolar as a mean over the group
33. mean drop of 42 millimolar of sweat at the highest dose as well showing nicely the exposure and sweat are tightly

35. we saw from week one onwards and at a low dose and exposure already statistical significant decrease in sweat chloride which
36. exposure already statistical significant decrease in sweat chloride which was dose dependent and we were very pleased to see that fev
37. don t forget what we measure here are the pre dose values so that s when the values are the lowest
38. on dosing do you feel like the 500 milligram bid dose therefore is the practice or is it possible that you
39. or is it possible that you might want to even dose at a higher level in future studies assuming it does
40. balance because on the one hand side you want to dose high enough to give patient the maximal efficacy on the
41. game we have more advanced data we exactly know the dose even under the saphira 1 to support dose later so
42. know the dose even under the saphira 1 to support dose later so that would play then i must say as
43. actual side effects that prevented you from exploring 800 milligram dose in saphira then the second question what would be your
44. reaching the predicted max efficacy with 1837 at 500 milligram dose and as you mentioned you have a small margin to

14. in fact this is the first trial in the g551d patient population as you all know by the approval of ivacaftor
15. all know by the approval of ivacaftor this is a patient population which is quite well served with the first drug
16. coming from their treatment so there was only one naive patient included in the study endpoints were safety and tolerability and
17. treatment so a very novel design as well the special patient setting requires this type of a special design let s
18. we ve lost two patients that were on treatment one patient we dropped inaudible part of the study and one patient
19. patient we dropped inaudible part of the study and one patient was taken out because of creatine phosphokinase increase and i
20. 30 years who were split from 19 to 51 oldest patient was 51 years old weight around 70 kilos it is
21. this we had three ses in two patients so one patient showed an acute increase of non cardiac creatine phosphokinase and
22. s hard to come to any conclusions so the second patient that showed two ses showed one se which was a
23. exacerbation on the last day of the study so this patient was for the pulmonary exacerbation taken up in the hospital
24. chloride change depending on the plasma exposure of the different patient groups do you have a sense for what determines plasma
25. lack of compliance or was there different absorption between different patient groups piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific officer 3 okay
26. so the question on the spread of plasma exposures the patient in the study had a diary and according to the
27. hand side you want to dose high enough to give patient the maximal efficacy on the other hand side you know
28. suggest that there is a change of responses of a patient depending on exposure to kalydeco like has that been shown
29. volunteers and as a last component the first exposure to patient we plan to do that in a triple combination setting
30. analyst 11 and then when you broke down the baseline patient characteristics by the pulmonary function based on levels basically so
31. severely affected was the population we ll keep the specific patient efficacy because if we talk about inaudible about specific patients
32. would say it would be a big surprise if a patient of around 40 would suddenly improve there so let s
33. well in the study and we were very also the patient of course was very fortunate because we believed he or

14. critical timeline is especially driven by 2737 so for the triple combination we aim to bring in patients mid next year
15. but the main goal is indeed to bring the best triple to patients and with that we hope to address both
16. industry and other groups in the efforts to bring forward triple therapies for all of the cf patients compound was safe
17. selecting doses that we re going to use in the triple combination so i want to thank you all for listening
18. you for the expected questions on the composition of our triple combo as i d tried to explain during the portfolio
19. the partner abbvie was there other question or no the triple for triple how do we move triple combination into patients
20. abbvie was there other question or no the triple for triple how do we move triple combination into patients so it
21. or no the triple for triple how do we move triple combination into patients so it s a mix of phase
22. exposure to patient we plan to do that in a triple combination setting meaning a triple combo as well will go
23. to do that in a triple combination setting meaning a triple combo as well will go in healthy volunteers first to
24. interaction and then move into patients with out of the triple combo 2737 will be the only component at that moment
25. this will be the how complex the way to our triple combo in patients currently debjit chattopadhyay janney montgomery scott analyst
26. that is correct yes the moment we will put a triple combination together we will have in healthy volunteers about two
27. as soon as possible as well access to an experimental triple combo because there is lot of hope for them as
28. be your main takeaway from this result in regards to triple combo and then more of a conceptual question but you
29. anastasia karpova kempen amp co analyst 34 in regards to triple combo piet wigerinck galapagos nv chief scientific officer 35 well
30. impact on 2451 therefore delta f508 patients in terms of triple combo is our main goal there is absolutely no difference
31. the second question is more on the future and the triple combination how do you see the timelines especially after the
32. our press release clearly hints to that so timelines for triple with this study well we can confirm anything like that
33. studies in this cf program is high but timelines for triple we can confirm then that we are on track to
34. confirm then that we are on track to bring a triple combination to patients by mid of next year thank you
35. scientific officer 43 i think if we now focus on triple combination there s going to be a combination of studies

18. that a little bit better so we can better be able to inform when it happens why it happens and how
19. will essentially say hey who are the people who are able to achieve their goal of reducing a1c with no safety
20. but i think we will have efficacy data to be able to show in a real world setting sotagliflozin should perform
21. have more data than anybody else and we will be able to give clear guidance and direction as we complete these
22. are thankful for your flexibility this morning and having been able to join this call despite the relatively short time frame

4. 500 milligram bid really was on the target of our exposure and for that group we expected the best results which
5. vitro data next slide please let s first start with exposure so on the x axis you have the time so
6. the study what you can see as well is the exposure to last week is a stable exposure so meaning that
7. well is the exposure to last week is a stable exposure so meaning that the variability is limited in that group
8. by design as well on the slide by dose and exposure we see a nice drop of sweat over time in
9. the left where you see the patients with the highest exposure now you can see in fact that the 50 milligram
10. sweat at the highest dose as well showing nicely the exposure and sweat are tightly correlated with glpg1837 next slide please
11. from week one onwards and at a low dose and exposure already statistical significant decrease in sweat chloride which was dose
12. questions i guess first question is just on the plasma exposure you showed pretty big difference in sweat chloride change depending
13. big difference in sweat chloride change depending on the plasma exposure of the different patient groups do you have a sense
14. groups do you have a sense for what determines plasma exposure was it lack of compliance or was there different absorption
15. then last question from me is just on the prior exposure to kalydeco you mentioned several times during the presentation that
16. is a change of responses of a patient depending on exposure to kalydeco like has that been shown for kalydeco that
17. seen healthy volunteers and as a last component the first exposure to patient we plan to do that in a triple
18. and the sweat chloride clearly was a function of the exposure levels was that also reflected in the fev1 levels that
19. to keep all of the graphs in the complex time exposure and sweat a little bit simple on kalydeco the mean
20. two patients that had the saes were they in the exposure above target or below target populations piet wigerinck galapagos nv
21. us where we can t link it to the drug exposure but it can be a single case can also for
22. drug development a fast case that when numbers increase or exposure increases you might see more so it really it was

24. together we will have in healthy volunteers about two weeks exposure in patients up to one month exposure we especially we
25. about two weeks exposure in patients up to one month exposure we especially we ll have been running pre clinical then
26. we have a three month study ongoing so there the exposure will be longer but it s clear that for the
27. it s clear that for the time limiting component 2737 exposure will be limited at the moment of the selection but
28. in a patient it is well tolerated you know the exposure and you know the efficacy of the potentiator so we
29. period and then secondly just with regards to the target exposure graph that you ve showed i guess i mean it
30. as though that in the group that had above target exposure the exposure continues to increase in week four suggesting some

21. day 8 so they have taken one week of the low dose and we measure the plasma levels before they start
22. days show exactly the same results inaudible even with the low dose although predicted to be sub optimal within one week
23. we have a statistical significant drop showing that as well low dosages starts to bind there although they are sub optimal
24. a slight further decrease of the fev showing that the low dose had no impact and maybe in the background of
