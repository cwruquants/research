  "text": "Good morning, and welcome to in congress Ryder System, Incorporated fourth-quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce Mr. Bob Brunn, Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Ryder. Mr. Brunn, you may begin.\n Thanks very much. Good morning, and welcome to Ryder's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings and 2016 forecast conference call.\n I would like to remind you that during this presentation, you will hear some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on Management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.\n Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in economic, business, competitive, market, political and regulatory factors. More detailed information about these factors is contained in this morning's earnings release and in Ryder's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n Presenting on today's call are Robert Sanchez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Art Garcia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Dennis Cooke, President of Global Fleet Management Solutions; John Diez, President of Dedicated Transportation Solutions, and Steve Sensing, President of Global Supply Chain Solutions, are on the call today and available for questions following the presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Robert.\n Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we'll recap our fourth-quarter 2015 results, review the asset management area, and discuss our forecasts for 2016. Then we'll open up the call for questions.\n With that, let's turn to an overview of our fourth quarter results. Comparable earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 for the fourth quarter 2015, up 4% from $1.60 in the prior year. Comparable results were below our forecast range of $1.72 to $1.82, but were impacted by $0.06 of unusual insurance-related items.\n Absent this, we were at the low end of our forecast range due to our used vehicle sales and rental results. Fourth quarter comparable results exclude $0.19 of restructuring and other costs, and $0.05 of nonoperating pension costs. The restructuring costs during the quarter are related to workforce reductions impacting approximately 250 employees, and to a lesser extent, the pending divestiture of a small logistics operation in Canada.\n Comparable earnings from the prior year exclude $1.38 primarily for pension buyout cost. Operating revenue which excludes fuel and subcontracted transportation revenue grew by 7% to a record $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter, and was higher in all business segments. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating revenue grew by 9%.\n Total revenue increased by 1% and was impacted by lower fuel costs passed through to customers, and foreign exchange. Page 5 includes some additional financial information for the fourth quarter. The average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased to 53.3 million shares, up from 53 million shares last year.\n In December, our prior repurchase program expired and we received Board authorization for a new two-year, 2 million anti-dilutive share repurchase plan. The new plan allows Management to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares issued to employees after December 1, 2015, and another 500,000 shares from the recently expired plan that were not repurchased while activity was paused in early 2015. We expect to begin repurchases in midyear 2016, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing, primarily based on our declining balance sheet leverage.\n Excluding pension costs and other items, the comparable tax rate was 32.1%, below the prior year's rate of 34.4%, reflecting a $2 million Canadian income tax settlement. Page 6 highlights key financial statistics on a full-year basis. Operating revenue grew at 6% to $5.6 billion, or increased by 8%, excluding FX.\n Comparable EPS from continuing operations were $6.13, up 10% from last year. The spread between adjusted return on capital and cost of capital widened to 140 basis points, up 30 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by higher leverage and higher earnings. I'll turn now to page 7 and discuss key trends we saw in the business segments during the quarter.\n Fleet Management Solutions operating revenue, which excludes fuel, grew 7%, driven mainly by growth in full-service lease and commercial rental. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, FMS operating revenue was up by 9%. Full-service lease revenue increased 7%, or 9% excluding FX, due to fleet growth and higher rates on replacement vehicles, reflecting the higher costs of new engine technology.\n The lease fleet grew organically by 6,800 vehicles year-over-year, excluding the impact from planned reductions of UK trailers. This was above our initial forecast of 4,000 vehicles for the year, and above our most recent forecast of 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles. Sequentially from the third quarter, the lease fleet increased by 1,600 vehicles excluding UK trailers.\n Miles driven per vehicle per day on US lease power units increased 1% versus the prior year and continued to run at normal historical levels. Contract maintenance revenue increased 2%. The average contract maintenance fleet grew by approximately 3,900 vehicles from the prior year and 4,100 units sequentially, reflecting a significant new customer that started up late in the fourth quarter and will primarily benefit revenue in 2016.\n Contract-related maintenance was up 14% from the prior year. Included in contract-related maintenance are 7,200 vehicles serviced during the quarter under on-demand maintenance agreements, an increase of 29% from the prior year. Commercial rental revenue was up 6% for the quarter, or 8% excluding FX.\n Although US demand increased, it was up by less than expected and reflected about two weeks' later start to the holiday shipping season versus our forecast. We also saw less robust demand than anticipated in the tractor class. Global pricing was up 3% for the quarter, reflecting higher pricing in the US and Canada, and was in line with our expectation.\n The average rental fleet grew by 7% from the prior year. Rental utilization on power units was 77.6%, down 250 basis points from the prior year, but still at a strong level. Utilization comparisons reflect the demand items I mentioned earlier, as well as unusually high utilization levels in the prior year.\n Although commercial rental delivered solid growth, due to a high level of uncertainty regarding the macro environment and somewhat less robust demand conditions with rental tractors, we made a decision to downsize our fleet during the quarter in order to more conservatively position our fleet for 2016. The ending rental fleet declined by 1,700 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter. Used vehicle results were negatively impacted primarily by lower pricing on tractors.\n I'll discuss those results separately in a few minutes. Overall, FMS earnings increased due to higher full-service lease results and solid rental performance. Better lease results reflect fleet growth and vehicle residual value benefits.\n These benefits were largely offset by lower used vehicle sales results and maintenance costs to downsize our rental fleet and reduce out-of-service vehicles. Earnings before tax and FMS increased 1%.\n FMS earnings as a percent of operating revenue were 12.4%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Of this 70 basis point decline, 60 basis points was due to used vehicle sales.\n I'll turn now to Dedicated Transportation Solutions on page 8. Operating revenue growth was strong at 11% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing. Total revenue was up 5%, reflecting lower fuel costs passed through to customers.\n DTS earnings increased 1% due to higher operating revenue and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a customer bankruptcy charge of $1.5 million. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 5.9%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. The bankruptcy charge negatively impacted EBT margins by approximately 80 basis points.\n I'll turn now to Supply Chain Solutions on page 9. Operating revenue grew 4% due to new business, higher pricing, and increased volumes. SCS operating revenue grew 7%, including the impact of foreign exchange.\n Total revenue was slightly down, as higher operating revenue was offset by lower third party purchase transportation costs, and lower fuel costs passed through to customers. SCS earnings before tax were up 5% due to operating revenue growth, improved operating performance, and overhead cost improvements, partially offset by a large medical claim of $2.2 million in the quarter. Segment earnings before tax as a percent of operating revenue were 7.4% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year.\n The large medical claim negatively impacted EBT percent by nearly 70 basis points. Page 10 shows the business segment view of the income statement I just discussed. It is included here for your reference.\n Page 11 reflects our full-year results by business segment. In the interest of time, I won't review these results in detail, but will just highlight the bottom line results. Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year.\n At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures.\n Thanks, Robert. Turning to page 12, full-year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion, to up $400 million from the prior year.\n This increase reflects full-service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed, as well as planned rental investments. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. That's down $70 million from the prior year.\n The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. Full-year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. Turning to the next page, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million.\n The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion.\n Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million, versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. Page 14 addresses our debt to equity position.\n Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year end 2014. Debt to equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year, and just above the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange, as well as vehicle investments to fund growth.\n Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year, primarily due to earnings partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update.\n Thanks, Art. Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year, and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter.\n This is at the high end of our target range of [6,000] to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range.\n We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year, but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors.\n Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9% and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall used prices were down 9%, as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak.\n The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units, or 12% during 2015, and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations this year. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past five years.\n I'll turn now to page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging.\n Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker commercial rental environment, as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year and we'll make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers.\n In -- our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015, as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings.\n In fleet management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trends that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles excluding UK trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles.\n We expect over a third of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the non-outsourced market. In rental, we're assuming softer conditions with demand forecasts down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012, but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession.\n Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly reflecting higher vehicle costs. As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4%, or 1,900 vehicles.\n Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period.\n Volumes are expected to be higher as we work down the inventory of vehicles that were out-serviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past five years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016, as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold.\n Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full-service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results, and to a lesser extent, commercial rental. Turning to page 19, DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of lease customers to Dedicated Solutions.\n Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance, and lower overhead costs. In supply chain, we expect revenue growth driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business.\n We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016, based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015.\n Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate, resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments.\n Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 to $6.30 in 2016, as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year.\n We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3%, up from last year's rate of 35.3%. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%.\n The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In fleet management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016, or 6% excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full-service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in commercial rental.\n FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. Full-service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6%, or 8% excluding FX. A higher lease fleet count due to new sales activity and higher lease fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs, are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions.\n Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We are forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in Dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity.\n Supply chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5%, or 7% excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62.\n Pricing on tractors is forecasted to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. Commercial rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values.\n Higher compensation expenses is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. 0This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical costs, and planned bonus. We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years.\n These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings such as on-demand and contract-related maintenance will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS.\n Growth in dedicated revenue combined with margin expansion should add $0.20. In supply chain, we expect an additional $0.25 driven primarily by growth. Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to better align our business with current market conditions.\n These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totalling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values.\n The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we are forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count, and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30 with the range of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year.\n I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow.\n Thanks, Robert. Turning to page 23, we're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth in a softer freight environment.\n We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better performing vehicle types.\n Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion.\n This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower growth spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will de-lever and we expect debt to equity to come down to 245% at year end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%.\n This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. We've talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment costs per unit, and its impact on cash flow.\n For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full-service lease with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease.\n An increase in the number of leased vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit costs will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the counter-cyclical nature of our business model. As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash.\n Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009. At this point, let me turn the call back over to Robert to recap our EPS forecast.\n Thanks, Art. Turning to page 25, we're forecasting EPS of $6.10 to $6.30 versus a comparable $6.13 last year. This improvement is despite a $0.24 negative impact a from higher tax rate, share count, and negative foreign exchange.\n We're also providing a first quarter EPS forecast of $1.03 to $1.08 versus a comparable prior year EPS of $1.08. The first quarter forecast reflects used vehicle sales headwinds and softer rental performance, as well as an atypical fuel benefit of $0.03 last year. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning.\n We had a lot of material covered today, with both the fourth quarter results and the 2016 outlook. As a result, I would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to get back in the queue and we'll take as many questions as we can in the time allotted.\n At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions.",

Comparable earnings from continuing operations were $327 million, up 10% from last year.\n At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Art Garcia, to cover several items, including capital expenditures.\n Thanks, Robert. Turning to page 12, full-year gross capital expenditures were $2.7 billion, to up $400 million from the prior year.\n This increase reflects full-service lease fleet growth due to customer contracts signed, as well as planned rental investments. We realized proceeds primarily from the sale of revenue-earning equipment of $427 million. That's down $70 million from the prior year.\n The decrease primarily reflects planned lower volumes of vehicles sold. Full-year net capital expenditures increased by $468 million to almost $2.3 billion. Turning to the next page, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.44 billion for 2015, up approximately $60 million.\n The increase was driven primarily by higher cash-based earnings. We generated almost $2 billion of total cash during the year, consistent with the prior year. Cash payments for capital expenditures increased by around $410 million to $2.7 billion.\n Free cash flow for 2015 was negative $728 million, versus the prior year negative of $315 million, reflecting increased capital expenditures to support growth. Our growth capital spend for 2015 was $1.3 billion. Page 14 addresses our debt to equity position.\n Total debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased by almost $800 million from year end 2014. Debt to equity at the end of 2015 increased to 278%, up from 260% in the prior year, and just above the top end of our target range of 225% to 275%. Leverage increased due to foreign exchange, as well as vehicle investments to fund growth.\n Year-end equity was just under $2 billion, up $168 million for the year, primarily due to earnings partially offset by foreign exchange and dividends. At this point, I'll hand the call back over to Robert to provide an asset management update.\n Thanks, Art. Page 16 summarizes key results for our asset management area. Used vehicle inventory held for sale was 8,000 vehicles, up from 5,500 vehicles in the prior year, and 1,900 vehicles above the third quarter.\n This is at the high end of our target range of [6,000] to 8,000 vehicles. The increased inventory reflects our decision during the fourth quarter to downsize rental fleet in order to position it more conservatively for 2016. We expect to work this inventory down over the next few quarters and end 2016 closer to the bottom end of our target range.\n We sold 4,500 used vehicles during the quarter, down 2% from the prior year, but up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. We sold 17,900 vehicles during the full year. During the quarter, used vehicle pricing declined by more than forecasted, particularly for tractors.\n Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, proceeds from vehicles sold were down 5% for tractors and up 5% for trucks. From a sequential standpoint, tractor pricing was down 9% and truck pricing was down 2% versus the third quarter of 2015. As compared to peak prices realized in the second quarter, overall used prices were down 9%, as compared to our expectations of down 7%, driven primarily by used tractor pricing, which was down 11% from the second quarter peak.\n The number of leased vehicles that were extended beyond their original lease term decreased versus last year by around 750 units, or 12% during 2015, and is well below recessionary levels. This reflects a lower number of lease contract expirations this year. Early termination of leased vehicles increased by 70 units this year and were generally in line with levels seen over the past five years.\n I'll turn now to page 18 to cover our outlook for 2016. Pages 18 and 19 highlight some of the key assumptions we've made in the development of our 2016 earnings forecast. As you know, the economic and freight environments are highly uncertain at the moment, which makes forecasting challenging.\n Our approach to the forecast was to assume a significant negative impact in used vehicle sales and a weaker commercial rental environment, as well as some headwinds in new lease sales. We think this is a prudent approach to our initial forecast for the year and we'll make any appropriate adjustment as conditions merit. When looking at our earnings forecast, it is especially important this year to consider the assumptions that are driving those numbers.\n In -- our 2016 forecast anticipates slow to moderate growth for the overall economy. We're expecting our average interest rate to be consistent with 2015, as lower fixed rate refinancing rates offset higher variable rates. We're assuming foreign exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, which will result in a negative year-over-year impact to both revenue and earnings.\n In fleet management, we're expecting continued growth in full service lease based on our strong recent sales activity and secular trends that favor outsourcing, somewhat offset by softer freight conditions. For 2016, we're forecasting lease fleet growth of 3,500 vehicles excluding UK trailers, which would be our fifth consecutive year of organic fleet growth. This is similar to the initial forecast we provided in 2015 of 4,000 vehicles.\n We expect over a third of our new lease sales to continue to come from customers new to outsourcing, driven by our initiatives to penetrate the non-outsourced market. In rental, we're assuming softer conditions with demand forecasts down 5%. This is worse than what we experienced in 2012, but not as bad as what we saw in the last freight recession.\n Utilization is expected to be down, especially in the first half, while pricing is forecast to be up slightly reflecting higher vehicle costs. As I mentioned earlier, we took actions during the fourth quarter to more conservatively position our fleet in light of a softer and uncertain market condition. For the full year, we expect the average rental fleet to be down 4%, or 1,900 vehicles.\n Our forecast also assumes used vehicle pricing will decrease materially in 2016, particularly for tractors. Tractor pricing is forecast to be down by 20% from the peak in the second quarter of 2015, which would drive an overall price decline of 11% across all vehicle types. This is equivalent to the price declines we've seen in other recent downturns, including the 2008-2009 period.\n Volumes are expected to be higher as we work down the inventory of vehicles that were out-serviced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Significant increases in used vehicle pricing over the past five years will benefit depreciation rates in 2016, as these results are blended into our vehicle residual calculation. These benefits will partially offset lower expected gains on used vehicles sold.\n Overall, we expect higher FMS earnings due to growth in our contractual full-service lease product line, partially offset by lower used vehicle sales results, and to a lesser extent, commercial rental. Turning to page 19, DTS revenue is forecast to benefit from strong new sales activity, including continued conversion of lease customers to Dedicated Solutions.\n Dedicated earnings will benefit from revenue growth, lower insurance, and lower overhead costs. In supply chain, we expect revenue growth driven by new sales, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. We're expecting volumes to be stable, with earnings growth coming from new business.\n We've made reductions in discretionary and overhead costs in order to align our business with slower expected market conditions. We anticipate resuming anti-dilutive share repurchases in the second half of 2016, based on our current leverage projections. Despite this modest increase in share -- despite this, a modest increase in share count will negatively impact earnings since repurchases have been paused since early 2015.\n Finally, we're forecasting an EPS headwind due to a higher tax rate, resulting from increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Page 20 provides a summary of key financial statistics for our 2016 forecast based on these assumptions. We're expecting operating revenue to grow 5%, with revenue growth in all business segments.\n Comparable earnings per share is forecast in a range of $6.10 to $6.30 in 2016, as compared to $6.13 last year. This reflects continued growth in our contractual product lines, offset by a softer expected environment for our transactional businesses. Our average diluted share count is forecast to increase to 53.6 million shares from 53.3 million last year.\n We project a comparable tax rate of 36.3%, up from last year's rate of 35.3%. The spread between our return on capital and cost of capital is forecast to narrow to 100 to 110 basis points, down by 30 to 40 basis points from last year, primarily reflecting lower results in used vehicle sales. Our 2016 return on equity forecast is 15.3%.\n The next page outlines our revenue expectations by business segment. In fleet management, operating revenue is expected to increase by 4% in 2016, or 6% excluding foreign exchange. FMS growth is driven primarily by higher full-service lease and contract maintenance revenue, partially offset by forecasted declines in commercial rental.\n FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 2 percentage points. Full-service lease revenue is forecast to grow by 6%, or 8% excluding FX. A higher lease fleet count due to new sales activity and higher lease fleet reflect increased vehicle cost -- vehicle investment costs, are expected to be partially offset by weaker freight conditions.\n Longer term, we continue to expect that FMS can deliver operating revenue growth in the high single digits due to both market trends and our initiatives to drive increased rates of outsourcing. We are forecasting a 4% decrease in rental revenue, reflecting expectations for weaker demand conditions. We're expecting operating revenue growth of 9% in Dedicated, reflecting strong new sales activity.\n Supply chain operating revenue is expected to grow by 5%, or 7% excluding foreign exchange, also reflecting new sales. Page 22 provides a chart outlining the key changes in our comparable EPS forecast from 2015 to 2016. Weaker market conditions in used vehicle sales are expected to impact earnings by $0.62.\n Pricing on tractors is forecasted to decline by 20% from peak, while truck pricing, which has been holding up better, is expected to decline by 5% from the peak. Sales volumes are expected to be higher due to the limited inventory available for sale in 2015. Commercial rental is expected to decrease EPS by $0.28 based on lower forecast demand and utilization on a smaller average fleet, partially offset by higher residual values.\n Higher compensation expenses is expected to impact earnings by $0.25 per share this year. 0This includes the cost of merit increases, higher medical costs, and planned bonus. We continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth, particularly for IT and sales initiatives, but at a slower pace than in recent years.\n These initiatives will reduce EPS by $0.09. Higher earnings from other FMS product offerings such as on-demand and contract-related maintenance will be partially offset by fuel, driven by a tightening wholesale versus retail spread. In total, these items are expected to contribute an additional $0.09 to EPS.\n Growth in dedicated revenue combined with margin expansion should add $0.20. In supply chain, we expect an additional $0.25 driven primarily by growth. Workforce restructuring and other cost savings actions were taken in order to better align our business with current market conditions.\n These actions are expected to generate an annual benefit of $0.38. The largest driver of 2015 EPS improvement is growth and increased returns in our contractual FMS product lines, totalling an additional $0.73 this year. This result -- this results from fleet growth and a depreciation benefit from higher residual values.\n The net impact of the operational items I've mentioned so far will result in an EPS of $6.54. In addition, however, we are forecasting a negative $0.24 impact from higher tax rate, increased share count, and impacts from foreign exchange. This brings the high end of our comparable EPS forecast to $6.30 with the range of $6.10 to $6.30 forecast for the year.\n I'll turn the call over to Art now to cover capital spending and cash flow.\n Thanks, Robert. Turning to page 23, we're forecasting total gross capital spending of $2 billion, down almost $700 million from last year, with lower spending in lease and significantly lower spending in rental. Lease capital is forecast to decrease by $280 million due to lower forecast fleet growth in a softer freight environment.\n We are planning minimal capital spending for rental of $90 million, down $430 million from the prior year. The average rental fleet is forecasted to decline by 4%. The planned spending here is related to a change in the fleet mix to drive activity with better performing vehicle types.\n Proceeds from used vehicle sales are forecast to increase by about 8% to $460 million. Higher sales volumes are expected to be partially offset by lower pricing, particularly on tractors. As a result, net capital expenditures are forecast at $1.6 billion.\n This represents a $700 million decrease from 2015. Free cash flow is forecast at positive $100 million, reflecting lower growth spending in lease and only a minimal replacement capital spend in rental. With higher expected free cash flow, the business will de-lever and we expect debt to equity to come down to 245% at year end, just below the midpoint of our target range of 225% to 275%.\n This will provide us with additional balance sheet flexibility going forward and will be the key driver in restarting anti-dilutive share repurchases. We've talked in recent years about the impact that higher growth capital spending has on the business. Page 24 highlights the amount of growth capital spending we've had by year, driven from both fleet growth and higher vehicle investment costs per unit, and its impact on cash flow.\n For 2016, we expect to spend $680 million in growth capital for full-service lease with no growth capital in rental. That compares to growth capital spend of $1.3 billion in 2015. The box on the right-hand side of the page highlights 2016 growth capital spending in lease.\n An increase in the number of leased vehicles will require $275 million of capital, while higher per-unit costs will require an additional $405 million. Free cash flow is favorably impacted by reduced capital expenditures, demonstrating the counter-cyclical nature of our business model. As you can see in the bottom line of the page, growth capital spending in recent years has significantly benefited operating cash.\n Operating cash flow is projected to be over $1.6 billion this year, up over 60% since 2009. At this point, let me turn the call back over to Robert to recap our EPS forecast.\n Thanks, Art. Turning to page 25, we're forecasting EPS of $6.10 to $6.30 versus a comparable $6.13 last year. This improvement is despite a $0.24 negative impact a from higher tax rate, share count, and negative foreign exchange.\n We're also providing a first quarter EPS forecast of $1.03 to $1.08 versus a comparable prior year EPS of $1.08. The first quarter forecast reflects used vehicle sales headwinds and softer rental performance, as well as an atypical fuel benefit of $0.03 last year. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning.\n We had a lot of material covered today, with both the fourth quarter results and the 2016 outlook. As a result, I would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to get back in the queue and we'll take as many questions as we can in the time allotted.\n At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions.",
